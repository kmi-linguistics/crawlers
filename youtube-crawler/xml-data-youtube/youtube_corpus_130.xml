            <video_title>New Brexit deal agreed but DUP refuses support - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>In a statement, the Democratic Unionist Party, which the government relies on for support in key votes, said: &quot;These proposals are not, in our view, beneficial to the economic well-being of Northern Ireland and they undermine the integrity of the Union.&quot;

It added: &quot;Saturday's vote in Parliament on the proposals will only be the start of a long process to get any Withdrawal Agreement Bill through the House of Commons.&quot;


A Brexit deal has been agreed between the UK and EU before a meeting of European leaders in Brussels.

Boris Johnson and Jean-Claude Juncker called it a &quot;fair&quot; outcome - and the EU Commission President said there was no need to extend the Brexit deadline.

He said: &quot;We have a deal so why should we have a prolongation.&quot;

This will be a boost for the PM, but he still faces a battle to get the deal through Parliament on Saturday, with the DUP opposing it.

Mr Johnson urged MPs to &quot;come together&quot; and &quot;get this excellent deal over the line&quot;.

He added: &quot;Now is the moment for us to get Brexit done and then together to work on building our future partnership, which I think can be incredibly positive both for the UK and for the EU.&quot;

               <original_script name="Roman">Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &amp;quot;between a rock and a hard place&amp;quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&amp;#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&amp;#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?</original_script>

What's that Owen? you didn't like the result of the referendum so you want to defy the will of the people and ignore it..... but you will respect the result of another referendum (if it goes your way).
*You have just shoved democracy up your arse* - *not delivering the Ist referendum invalidates all future referendums* - don't you get it? ignore one referendum, ignore them all, because you will make referendums useless.

By the way.

You call me weak yet thanks to my Union I have had payrises.

You are the weak one because you stand alone and haven't had any payrises.

Can you see who is the weak one out of the two of us?

            <comment_content_initial>Oh dear.

You're in denial. 

Good luck with your project. 

When you are worse off, be proud of the fact that you CHOSE to be worse off. 

Those people you hate are trying to help you.

But you're beyond help.

You really think you're going to be better off?

When was the last time a Tory improved your life?

ps You say you can find anything on the internet, ok, find a link that says that there are too many lorry drivers in the UK and that's why you haven't had a payrise. 

I'll bet you cant. 

Instead of blaming other drivers,  why is your employer using cheap labour to undercut you?

Nothing to do with the EU,  everything to do with your boss.

He's got a better house, better car and has had payrises, you're being used and blaming the wrong people. 

He must be pissing himself laughing at you.</comment_content_initial>

Your Polish immigrants will merely be replaced by Asian and African immigrants instead.

            <comment_content_initial>@Ash Rowland mufc 

No need to use insults just because you have no facts.

The UK has a HGV driver shortage of 50,000 drivers, so how can you claim that your wages are kept low by EU workers?

It is kept low by employers. 

Which union are you in that is fighting for your payrise? 

When have you and your fellow drivers withheld your labour in order to get a payrise? 

If you don't demand better money,  you're not going to get offered it just because employers are nice people.

Focus, don't just accept lies.

Boris has moved Workers Rights from compulsory to voluntary,  do you think he did that because he wants you to be better off?

Wake up.</comment_content_initial>

I didn't say Labour are blocking no-deal, MP's of all parties are blocking it because it's so damaging. 

Brexit is self-harm, Boris doesn't care whether we stay or leave, he just wants to claim it's everyone else's fault it hasn't happened.

You&amp;#39;re not big or intelligent  enough to take on Europe, the Irish government nor the influence of Irish America who are long established in US politics and whom have made quite explicit comments that any interference to the Good Friday Accord shall not be tolerated. One more thing DUP, I&amp;#39;m English and neither myself nor my companions want you involved in our Nation so you guys live in peace in your country and leave us Brits to our country.

               <original_script name="Roman">But the DUP do seem to have enough influence in the HoC to block any Withdrawal Agreement that they are not happy with. It was always going to be a very dangerous policy for any UK government to allow the DUP to hold so much influence within the HoC. Northern Ireland is part of the UK whether you like it or not and it will remain part of the UK for a long time to come. The UK contribute £10bn pa to keep NI afloat. But in return for this money, you get the DUP influencing UK domestic and foreign policy - well worth every penny.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">I do wish the BBC did an investigation into the current state of the EU. Spain is dealing with an attempted break away province, France is having the Yellow Vest riots, Germany is having a rash of right wing then anti right wing protests, Sweden is having an up-tic in bombings, though they are having their media relabel such, and I am sure there are more that I am not aware of in other EU countries. One must remember that the Allies and Finland were the only reason that Stalin didn&amp;#39;t go forth with his desire to concur Europe. Ukraine was up for NATO/OTAN membership, but was invaded by Russia. Finland was entering negotiations to join the treaty, but a stern threat was issued by Putin, so that ended. Now the UK is leaving the EU, Why would this help the Russians? Anything to shake the cohesion of the NATO/OTAN union would help. Also, having an American president so deeply in debt to them, making the US more or less a Vichy state, who withdrew from Syria so that Russia and Turkey could exert military force. This gives Russia a bit of sway and influence with another NATO ally.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">So the DUP seems dead set on Northern Ireland returning to a place of revolt and grief by standing in the way of the only type of solution that can work here short of the northern irish not acting like tempestuous children with explosives.  But its not just the DUP, but Labour and whomever else votes against it this coming weekend in the UK Parliament.  At this very late stage about 2 weeks left till the brexit date there are two options and only 2 options it appears: 1) Leave under the terms of this newest deal (which would prevent a hard customs border being set up between Ireland and Northern Ireland, or 2) Leave under the default (no deal) which will require a hard customs border all along the Ireland/Northern Ireland border.  The odds of the EU approving another extensions IF the PM goes back next week if the deal is rejected in the Commons, are low if you believe the talking heads.  So regardless of whether UK law requires the PM to ask for an extension and he does so, the EU is under no obligation to grant it, yet again, unless there is a clear sign that the UK government was on its way to getting past this Commons logjam it has been in for 3+ years on this issue.&lt;br /&gt;But a party or minority or even majority in Northern Ireland won&amp;#39;t get the right to change things around at will going forward independent of the EU/UK.  That political situation is a nonstarter.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But in the end this is the case: under brexit Ireland will be in the EU, and Northern Ireland will be outside the EU, so they are in effectively two different customs zones, and as such there has to be a customs border between them.  Or the customs border is, as in the prior &amp;#39;deal&amp;#39; and this new &amp;#39;deal, between the island of Ireland and the island of Britain with N.I remaining for many things inside the EU customs union.  But this isn&amp;#39;t Schrödingers cat here,  Northern Ireland cannot be both in the EU and not in the EU at the same time.  Pick one.  Then deal with the consequences of your choice.  And if you choose some of the options, the folks in Northern Ireland that cannot behave as adults appear to be threatening to commit acts of violence again.  And that will be something for the UK to then deal with.</original_script>

It will be a VERY shaky alliance though and one that only exists to primarily stop the Tories and then maybe call a 2nd Ref, *maybe*.

I have always thought that demand for a product controls the supplier and availability of the product controls demand. So in fact, no-one is in control of anything! Ironically a good example of this would a recent article I read that said the U.K. has past the mid-point of using renewable energy sources (I love that), while America has taken the great leap backwards to fossil fuels. The point being the American government (Trump)  cannot control the future of energy at all. Eventually America will be pulled into the renewable energy usage and have to rely on other countries for the latest technologies in that field because America wanted to be in control.

            <comment_content_initial>@Kras T. I agree, people got caught up in Cameron foolish (tragically so) attempt to gain more power,  didn't have the extensive knowledge key to make  a legitimate choice ( they've been lied to), but remainers didn't or couldn't avoid the referendum.
Hence the necessity either to work for the best way possible to honour it (this should be the brexiteers' job... 😑), or to  build the circumstances in which another referendum, and a different outcome, would be possible. 
It is not what they've wished for but, in my truly humble opinion, it is the only way for remainers, + the  indecisive Labour party leader, to  maintain some credibility while giving the people a chance to  keep their faith in democracy.
Today is 19 October  and I don't see much of this,  from either side of Parliament 😒

            <comment_content_initial>@Don Scott 

Serves them right. 

The DUP tried luring Labour into calling a VONC against May, by telling them they would support them, only to back the Tories. 

They knew all along that the Tories were going to screw them over, yet still voted with them.

They've entirely brought this on themselves and can now congratulate themselves that between them and the Conservative and Unionist Party they have put the wheels in motion for a United Ireland.</comment_content_initial>

The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &amp;quot;between a rock and a hard place&amp;quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&amp;#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&amp;#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &amp;quot;between a rock and a hard place&amp;quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&amp;#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&amp;#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">Ahh,,,,what a difference a year makes. The only friends on this planet that the dup have are the Tories. The dup are anti-Labour, anti-SNP, anti-Lib Dems, anti-Irish, anti humanitarians, anti-Catholic, anti-American, anti-European, anti-human rites anti etc, etc, etc. What they are, are pro sectarian, pro anarchy, pro Monarchy, pro-capitalist (against the working and non-working classes) pro career politicians, pro-jobs for the boys, etc, etc, etc and so on and on. They are stuck in the 1600s. They are the bain of the ordinary working-class Loyalist people who are so desperately seeking a better life for their children. The DUP and their lackeys the Tories are doing absolutely nothing to help the working classes progress. In fact, they are consistently holding that group of British citizens, whom they so adamantly claim to be helping, in the poverty, they have been born into. Where do they stand today? At a cliff edge, staring disaster in the eye!. One can not get a better example of being stuck &amp;quot;between a rock and a hard place&amp;quot;. The only way they can go from here is almost certainly negative. If there was a general election in the morning, just take a moment to think about the possible outcomes,,, Labour gets a majority government. The dup are anti-Labour/Corbyn and will get thrown under the bus. The Tories get a majority? they really will be thrown under the bus (maybe, many buses?) as their ten votes would be null and void. A hung parliament? The best outcome for the dup. They could hold the balance of power and have great influence and so strengthen the Union. Well God damn it! that&amp;#39;s what we already have and what benefit has the dup gained? Well, as fate would have it, they have put their beloved union in jeopardy and were thrown under the Boris bus. You couldn&amp;#39;t make it up. Boris is a career politician, just like the dup members all are. Self-centred, only concerned with their own legacies at the expense of their constituents whom they claim to look after. They have dug their own graves. Their only friend on the planet has done them over. Need I say more?</original_script>

In the long run it is up to Ireland , north &amp;amp; south to continue to be an integrated, peaceful community, where people are free to trade, live in harmony.  Whilst still being close to the UK.

               <original_script name="Roman">Junker does not have the authority to refuse an extension. The EU may be getting frustrated with the inability on the UK to agree on any deal, but they will not refuse an extension for they know that this would allow the UK to exit without a deal - they won&amp;#39;t allow this to happen. So the new deal wont get through the HoC and so the EU will give an extension until Jan 31st.  The uk will have a general election and we will all be back at the start. The uk government will then give into demands for a 2nd referendum and the remainers will probably win - then Brexit can be forgotten about and never to be seen again.</original_script>

Look up the term &quot;hearsay:&quot; https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Heresay
A statement made out of court that is offered in court as evidence to prove the truth of the matter asserted.

               <original_script name="Roman">&lt;b&gt;*HAIL BRUTUS*&lt;/b&gt; Boris JOHNSON
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;so  you have finally done it, as solidly predicted, for weeks now, 
&lt;br /&gt;FORCING NEW enslaving TREATY
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;for and on UK, selling down DUP, Wales and SCOTLAND,  as just pawns on your CHESSBOARD,  
&lt;br /&gt;game,  what will be lost in the 
&lt;br /&gt;UK PARLIAMENT and FIRMLY REJECTED. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So you can then play wounded BAMBI role, as the &amp;quot;SAVER&amp;quot; MESSIAH, who tried, but sadly olive branch you sat on, was cut underneath you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Why we suffered headaches 3 and half years of nightmares, BIG TOP CIRCUS performance 
&lt;br /&gt;when you masterminded and agreed to 95%
&lt;br /&gt;May&amp;#39;s deal. 
&lt;br /&gt;WELL BORIS, now acting, now like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN incarnated, looking at you, as you speak from both corners of the mouth and spitting falseness as you speak, with sugary tongue, KARMA WILL TEACH YOU BIG LESSONS, boyo...
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Were 5 minutes of ***FAME to you***, back-slapping, JUDAS kissing worthy to you to BETRAY MILLIONS of UK &amp;amp; Northern Ireland population?
 Like a catfish, you swallowed  EU bait, hook, line and sinker. With STINKING BAIT.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;***Education and knowledge are LEARNED, but WISDOM is EARNED.***&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Lacking real personal principles and dignity, by this &amp;quot;SURRENDER ACT&amp;quot;-SELL-OUT and BETRAYAL, to save your job in # 10 for a few more weeks,  history will not look at you with kindness.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Visions and all PREDICTIONs weeks in advance proved 110% correct and you did not FAIL in dastardly nefarious game. You acting now like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN aka Boris Johnson, perfectly fulfilled your historical role as **OH, YOU TOO BRUTUS**?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Cries (with false crocodile tears)- to people I HAVE TRIED, trust me, ~(oh sure)~,  but as it is not my fault all fell apart, will only EXPOSE MORE, your dark intentions for self-ENGRADIOSMENT. 
&lt;br /&gt;YOUR NEW TREATY with EU will be firmly rejected as non-starter **BRUTUS**Neville CHAMBERLAIN aka Boris JOHNSON. Be ashamed of your dastardly nefarious act.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;HOPEFULLY, by now 67 million of good people see THROUGH you who BORIS JOHNSON is really like.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;IF &lt;b&gt;DUP&lt;/b&gt; agrees to this treaty deal you masterminded, they are truly DUPED. 
&lt;br /&gt;Manipulated by you for own interests. NOT for the betterment of UK NATION.
&lt;br /&gt;REMOTE VIEWING is a fantastic tool. So is reading your mind.  SHOCKING manipulator.
&lt;br /&gt;OUR GREAT NATION ~UNITED KINGDOM,~ should be deadly worried about you at the helm

            <comment_content_initial>**HAIL BRUTUS** Boris JOHNSON

so  you have finally done it, as solidly predicted, for weeks now, 
FORCING NEW enslaving TREATY

for and on UK, selling down DUP, Wales and SCOTLAND,  as just pawns on your CHESSBOARD,  
game,  what will be lost in the 
UK PARLIAMENT and FIRMLY REJECTED. 

So you can then play wounded BAMBI role, as the &quot;SAVER&quot; MESSIAH, who tried, but sadly olive branch you sat on, was cut underneath you.

Why we suffered headaches 3 and half years of nightmares, BIG TOP CIRCUS performance 
when you masterminded and agreed to 95%
May's deal. 
WELL BORIS, now acting, now like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN incarnated, looking at you, as you speak from both corners of the mouth and spitting falseness as you speak, with sugary tongue, KARMA WILL TEACH YOU BIG LESSONS, boyo...

Were 5 minutes of ***FAME to you***, back-slapping, JUDAS kissing worthy to you to BETRAY MILLIONS of UK &amp; Northern Ireland population?
 Like a catfish, you swallowed  EU bait, hook, line and sinker. With STINKING BAIT.
****Education and knowledge are LEARNED, but WISDOM is EARNED.****
Lacking real personal principles and dignity, by this &quot;SURRENDER ACT&quot;-SELL-OUT and BETRAYAL, to save your job in # 10 for a few more weeks,  history will not look at you with kindness.

Visions and all PREDICTIONs weeks in advance proved 110% correct and you did not FAIL in dastardly nefarious game. You acting now like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN aka Boris Johnson, perfectly fulfilled your historical role as **OH, YOU TOO BRUTUS**?

Cries (with false crocodile tears)- to people I HAVE TRIED, trust me, ~(oh sure)~,  but as it is not my fault all fell apart, will only EXPOSE MORE, your dark intentions for self-ENGRADIOSMENT. 
YOUR NEW TREATY with EU will be firmly rejected as non-starter **BRUTUS**Neville CHAMBERLAIN aka Boris JOHNSON. Be ashamed of your dastardly nefarious act.

HOPEFULLY, by now 67 million of good people see THROUGH you who BORIS JOHNSON is really like.

IF *DUP* agrees to this treaty deal you masterminded, they are truly DUPED. 
Manipulated by you for own interests. NOT for the betterment of UK NATION.
REMOTE VIEWING is a fantastic tool. So is reading your mind.  SHOCKING manipulator.
OUR GREAT NATION ~UNITED KINGDOM,~ should be deadly worried about you at the helm

               <original_script name="Roman">The Unionist population of Northern Ireland are descendants of immigrants who were moved there a few centuries ago by the British government which wanted to consolidate their power in Ireland which Britain had occupied, just like it had occupied countries all over the world because imperialism was the word of the day. Now that imperialism is dead, I have a suggestion. Why don&amp;#39;t the loyalists get the fuck out of Ireland, where they never had any business being in the first place, and simply move back to British mainland, so that Ireland may be free, and belong solely to the Irish people?</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>The Unionist population of Northern Ireland are descendants of immigrants who were moved there a few centuries ago by the British government which wanted to consolidate their power in Ireland which Britain had occupied, just like it had occupied countries all over the world because imperialism was the word of the day. Now that imperialism is dead, I have a suggestion. Why don't the loyalists get the fuck out of Ireland, where they never had any business being in the first place, and simply move back to British mainland, so that Ireland may be free, and belong solely to the Irish people?</comment_content_initial>

All of the countries within the UK, will continue to have a good relationship, as friendly neighbours, even if the union were to break up... being in a union is not essential in order to have good country to country relationships!</comment_content_initial>

I&amp;#39;m not a leaver btw, I didn&amp;#39;t vote in the referendum as I wasn&amp;#39;t eligible.  I never mentioned the EU in the comment above.  Doesn&amp;#39;t sound like you&amp;#39;re good at maths or even English for that matter.  No matter which side of the argument you stand on you should accept the result of the referendum, that&amp;#39;s what democracy is about.  It might be the right decision, it might be the wrong decision, but it&amp;#39;s democracy, which a lot of people fail to understand.</original_script>
