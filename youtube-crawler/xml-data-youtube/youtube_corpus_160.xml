            <video_title>Iran football: Women attend first match in decades - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Iranian women have attended a World Cup qualifier in Tehran after being freely allowed to enter a stadium for a men's match for the first time in decades.

Women have effectively been banned from stadiums when men are playing since just after the 1979 Islamic revolution.

The change followed the death of a fan who had set herself alight after being arrested for trying to attend a match.

But Amnesty International described the move on Thursday as a &quot;cynical publicity stunt&quot;.

The human rights organisation said there were only a &quot;token number&quot; of tickets for female fans as it called for all restrictions on female attendance to be lifted.

More than 3,500 women bought tickets to Thursday's World Cup qualifier against Cambodia, where they were granted access to a special women's-only section of the Azadi Stadium. The stadium has a capacity of about 78,000.

I am a conservative however telling this. Funny thing is if these women are so much after equality they should go to their women&amp;#39;s Football instead which 99% of them won&amp;#39;t go there to support Iranian female footballers.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">Anyone in U.K. who watches live TV broadcasts on TV or radio or watched or receives any BBC TV or radio by laws has to pay for the BBC TV license.  Now if you don’t pay the BBC TV license you can be fined or go to prison .  Many people are confused and believed just because they have a TV in their house assume they have to pay the BBC TV license and they do not wish to face prison or heavy fines if they don’t so they pay it. Now it may be possible that they didn’t need to pay for the license. If you look at the rules they are often vague and intimidating should the fee not be paid. The government have a BBC charter in place allowing these laws to exist and be enforced.  The BBC is absolutely not allowed to be biased and if there is a bias complaints have to be filed via two concurrent methods via the BBC complaints service and failing the outcome of this the third line of appeal is through OFCOM . It really is very beurocratic and long winded .   There is no freedom of choice and there is unfortunately plenty of bias.  It is long winded and complex deliberately in order to maintain the current level of subscriptions to the BBC TV license which collects many billions of pounds per year.  In summary the government allows laws to exist which are unfair.</original_script>

Do not white wash the american hands , who intervened  in other countries throughout history.
America with the warmongering policies ,changed the course of political movements  who were seeking Democracy. and that is as bad as overthrowing a government !!!
You seem to forget that regime change from the Shah to his succourers was all planned by the US.
Remember 1953 coup d'etat against the  lawful elect prime minister of Iran(Mossadeq) in favour of the Shah  and again  the American hands behind  the fall of the Shah of Iran in 1979 ?
The one country that has caused most amount of chaos and blood shed in the world since the second world war is the US.</comment_content_initial>
