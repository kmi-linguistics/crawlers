            <video_title>New Brexit deal agreed, says Boris Johnson - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>A Brexit deal has been agreed between UK and EU negotiating teams before a meeting of European leaders in Brussels.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson tweeted: &quot;We've got a great new deal that takes back control.&quot;

The two sides have been working on the legal text of a deal, but it will still need the approval of both the UK and European parliaments.

The DUP has cast doubt on its success, saying they still cannot support it.

The Northern Irish party earlier released a statement saying they could not back proposals &quot;as things stand&quot;, and - after the PM's announcement - said their statement &quot;still stands&quot;.

They are both responsible for the uprising of the far right in the UK. They should have both predicted all of this mess. If Boris will somehow do a deal it won&amp;#39;t be a brexit deal. Everything will remain the same it will just be a load of agreements but life will be pretty much the same. Its just a whole lot of drama that kind of drama far right girls like.

            <comment_content_initial>Treacherous Swinson.. 

What a piece of work.

1. Voted in favour of the Bedroom Tax.

2. Voted for the introduction of UC.

3.Voted in favour of scrapping the Educational Maintenance Allowance. 

4.Voted in favour of increasing Tuition Fees.

5.Voted in favour of capping benefits below inflation.

Quote: &quot;We shouldn't have allowed the bedroom tax to go through&quot;.

Quote: &quot;We need to learn from those errors&quot;

And 6: I would &quot; Revoke Article 50&quot; . 

No change there then Ms Swinson.

This young lady is playing a game of fantasyland politics. She is still wet behind the ears and clearly has a complete disregard for democracy. 
&quot;Liberal Democrats&quot;. Pure fantasy and a walking contradiction.</comment_content_initial>

Face it, the UK are looking at another extension until Jan 31st.  There will be a general election but unlikely that any party will be returned with a majority. So this is going to drag on well into 2020 - the EU will have until 4Q20 before they finalise their budget so don&amp;#39;t be surprised if negotiations go on until then.

If they vote for it we will leave with the deal (Treaty as JCJ calls it) on the 31st and the whole saga will be over!!&lt;br /&gt;The majority of the UK voted to leave because of this power the EU now had over the UK sanctioned over many years by our politicians.

But for the others who are desperate to avoid a hard brexit what could be better than a deal which is criticised as so soft not leaving at all....?   Perhaps another referendum!

What does the UK produce that the world wants? SE Asia produces everything. America buys everything and owns most intellectual properties. They also produce weapons which the world buys.

This time the Brit&amp;#39;s have put the gun to their own heads and are calling themselves chicken if they dont play Russian roulette with their finger already on the trigger. At least the Brit&amp;#39;s get to vote,  the Irish just had to sign. First real benefit to the Irish since we got are independence. No Brexit south of the border.</original_script>

&lt;br /&gt;so  you have finally done it, as solidly predicted, for weeks now, 
&lt;br /&gt;FORCING NEW enslaving TREATY
&lt;br /&gt;for and on UK, selling down DUP, Wales and SCOTLAND,  as just pawns on your CHESSBOARD,  
&lt;br /&gt;game,  what will be lost in the 
&lt;br /&gt;UK PARLIAMENT and FIRMLY REJECTED. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;So you can then play wounded BAMBI role, as the &amp;quot;SAVER&amp;quot; MESSIAH, who tried, but sadly olive branch you sat on, was cut underneath you.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Why we suffered headaches 3 and half years of nightmares, BIG TOP CIRCUS performance 
&lt;br /&gt;when you masterminded and agreed to 95%
&lt;br /&gt;May&amp;#39;s old TREATY deal. 
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;WELL BORIS, now acting, like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN incarnated, looking at you, as you speak from both corners of the mouth and spitting falseness as you speak, with sugary tongue, KARMA WILL TEACH YOU BIG LESSONS, boyo...
&lt;br /&gt;Were 5 minutes of ***FAME to you***, back-slapping, huge embraces JUDAS kissing worthy to you to BETRAY MILLIONS of UK &amp;amp; Northern Ireland population?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt; Like a catfish, you swallowed  EU bait, hook, line and sinker. With STINKING BAIT.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;b&gt;***Education and knowledge are LEARNED, but WISDOM is EARNED.***&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Lacking real personal principles and dignity, by this &amp;quot;SURRENDER ACT&amp;quot;-SELL-OUT and BETRAYAL, to save your job in # 10 for a few more weeks,  history will not look at you with kindness.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Visions and all PREDICTIONs weeks in advance proved 110% correct and you did not FAIL in dastardly nefarious game. You acting now like NEVILLE CHAMBERLAIN aka Boris Johnson, perfectly fulfilled your historical role as **OH, YOU TOO BRUTUS**?
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Cries (with false crocodile tears)- to people I HAVE TRIED, trust me, ~(oh sure)~,  but as it is not my fault all fell apart, will only EXPOSE MORE, your dark intentions for self-ENGRADIOSMENT. 
&lt;br /&gt;YOUR NEW TREATY with EU will be firmly rejected as non-starter **BRUTUS**Neville CHAMBERLAIN aka Boris JOHNSON. Be ashamed of your dastardly nefarious act.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;HOPEFULLY, by now 67 million of good people see THROUGH you who BORIS JOHNSON is really like.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;IF &lt;b&gt;DUP&lt;/b&gt; agrees to this NEW treaty deal you masterminded, they are truly DUPED. 
&lt;br /&gt;Manipulated by you for own interests. NOT for the betterment of the UK NATION as a WHOLE
&lt;br /&gt;.
&lt;br /&gt;REMOTE VIEWING is a fantastic tool. So is reading your mind.  SHOCKING manipulator.
&lt;br /&gt;OUR GREAT NATION ~UNITED KINGDOM,~ should be deadly worried about you at the helm

Not staying in the customs union and accepting WTO terms;

               <original_script name="Roman">@Lauren Henley You don&amp;#39;t get a near-overnight drop in hospital death rates because of funding - you do when you stop overworking workers, no matter how educated the type of worker  (doctors, nurses et al). Hence, removal of worker-protection in this deal makes it worse than May&amp;#39;s.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;As for EU expenditure vs NHS funding - the two are not closely linked. There&amp;#39;s currently huge amounts of wastage in the system that has zero to do with the EU (my mother runs a PCT, so I have first hand experience of this).  Moreover, once EU checks and balances are removed, drugs will begin to sharply increase in price. There isn&amp;#39;t capacity in the system to pay for that increase in capital outlay, so provision will be refused via the NHS, and the cost passed on to the end-user if they can afford it (hint- you can&amp;#39;t afford it), and eventually lead to insurance company-led healthcare a la America.  Again, I suspect another &amp;#39;Tory aim, as their interests are aligned with big business, especially insurers and reinsurers as they are such heavyweight financial investment bodies - no guarantee they&amp;#39;ll remain based in the UK after Brexit though, ofc.</original_script>

I think in the short term, 5 years at least, it will be incredibly painful for everyone, well, not the rich obviously, but especially those at the lower end of the financial spectrum. I think 5 years might be overly optimistic, didn&amp;#39;t JRG say that we wouldn&amp;#39;t feel the benefits for 30 years? &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;So no, I don&amp;#39;t disagree that short term is going to be painful for a lot of people, but unless those that voted to leave pick up their placards and march on Westminster demanding we re-enter the EU, we are at the mercy of democracy and the machinations of politicians.</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>@William Peterson 

They could only achieve that IF THEY WERE DEMOCRATIC ALLY ELECTED. 

How is that any different to the Brexit Party pursuing a no-deal Brexit, because no majority voted for that either?

But if they got elected on that manifesto they would have earned the democratic right to do so.

It's the definition of democracy.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Sarah Andrews - what?! 1st you say it is about immigration, once you see EU immigration go down in proportion to world immigration going up, and you realise an economy needs an expanding workforce, and your policy is, let us say, a little racist. Then it wasn&amp;#39;t about that, was it? Then it was about the money, but then you learnt a good deal will have you worse off and a no deal will have you much worse off, the poorer you are the worse it gets. But no, it wasn&amp;#39;t about money, was it? Then it was about sovereignty, until BoJo was such a Twot he made a new law? The argument isn&amp;#39;t if we leave the world will fall apart, it is that we will be worse off. Yet you still want it, why? Fanatical maybe?

               <original_script name="Roman">English Gentleman - what is great about remaining? Firstly, non-isolationist politics, you will conduct yourself better in the world without an arrogant attitude. As human beings we have advanced to this level by working in large international groups. The issue that a small man working on his own is going to be better than the collective is a farce. Massive science projects across Europe happen involving energy and space, only possible due to the EU working together. The foundation of the EU was pushed forwards by Churchill after the 2nd World War. The idea was that European countries were in a constant state of war and flux, unification and working together stopped all that, likely a very good idea. Your right to live, work and travel across a large block of similarly minded countries. Business, banking and economy has boomed within the EU, especially for the U.K. I could go on and on, small things like building safety standards, free roaming charges on mobile. Too many an advantage to list. And I do agree that the most important thing about our future is good leadership. Which has always been my strongest argument against leaving.

            <comment_content_initial>English Gentleman - what is great about remaining? Firstly, non-isolationist politics, you will conduct yourself better in the world without an arrogant attitude. As human beings we have advanced to this level by working in large international groups. The issue that a small man working on his own is going to be better than the collective is a farce. Massive science projects across Europe happen involving energy and space, only possible due to the EU working together. The foundation of the EU was pushed forwards by Churchill after the 2nd World War. The idea was that European countries were in a constant state of war and flux, unification and working together stopped all that, likely a very good idea. Your right to live, work and travel across a large block of similarly minded countries. Business, banking and economy has boomed within the EU, especially for the U.K. I could go on and on, small things like building safety standards, free roaming charges on mobile. Too many an advantage to list. And I do agree that the most important thing about our future is good leadership. Which has always been my strongest argument against leaving. Your own leadership, investment and advancement in tech, and social mobility are the big 3 things that will affect your future. But looking at this government acting like children while the EU have been proper and upstanding hasn’t convinced me of leaving the EU. In fact over the past 4 years your programme of misinformation has changed me from someone that wasn’t liking the EU much to someone that wants to end local politics and function under a one nation EU state.

There is a transition period, between Nov 1st and when we will have to fend for ourselves on WTO, I think it's 1 year but maybe it's longer or shorter I don't know sorry.


Scotland isn't going to quit the UK on November 1st.

Parliament can't use May's deal because that's not the deal just agreed to by the EU. They won't be going back to a deal that was already binned.

Ireland will not go back to significant violence. There will be no border, and UK will still be in the EU for years to come.

If no withdrawal agreement is voted into law and we leave the EU on the 31st with no such agreement then every paramilitary group in Ireland are gonna be making like squirrels and trying to find where they buried their weapons.


The main difference between Boris' deal and Mays deal is that May was unwilling to lose DUP support and place a border down the Irish Sea, not much else in the agreement has changed but this single change creates a significant different outcome.</comment_content_initial>

But most likely because Boris appears more Farage than Farage, 
Cons will get in just to sort out Brexit.

The liberal undemocrats think Brexit crowd won't vote and they can just be ignored, 
It's actually the remainers who are more divided, the loud angry Brexiteers will vote Boris.</comment_content_initial>
