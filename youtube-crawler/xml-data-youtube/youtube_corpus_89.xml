Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

               <original_script name="Roman">Hello from Belgium! Question, with all of the permafrost that is melting around the globe, doesn&amp;#39;t that change the way the magma moves underneath the plates? I herd from a scientific report that because of the melt the the weight of the ice no longer pushing down on crust is causing the crust to rise, so we can say that that this movement changes the magma flow direction?  If this is true isn&amp;#39;t it safe to say that we can also blame all of this extra plate tectonic movements which are causing all of these earth quakes on climate change?</original_script>
