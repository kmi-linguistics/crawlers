            <video_title>Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi: IS leader 'killed in US operation' in Syria - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>“He was a sick and depraved man, and now he’s gone. Baghdadi was vicious and violent and he died in a vicious and violent way” 

US President Donald Trump says the “world is now a much safer place” after the killing of IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi

The fugitive leader of the Islamic State (IS) group has been killed in a US military operation in northwest Syria, President Donald Trump has said.

Speaking from the White House, Mr Trump said Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi detonated his suicide vest after being caught at the end of a tunnel by special forces.

Baghdadi came to prominence in 2014, when he announced the creation of a &quot;caliphate&quot; in areas of Iraq and Syria.

IS carried out a number of atrocities that resulted in thousands of deaths.

The jihadist group imposed a brutal rule on almost eight million people in the areas under its control and was behind a number of attacks in cities around the world. The US declared the &quot;caliphate&quot; defeated earlier this year.</video_description>
