            <video_title>Brexit vote countdown - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Boris Johnson's Brexit deal is on a knife-edge, with the numbers too close to call ahead of a crucial vote in the House of Commons. He needs 320 votes to get it passed - but has only 287 Conservative MPs. It means he must persuade some Labour rebels, ex-Tories, and sceptics in his own party to support him.  
Tonight’s main report is from the BBC’s Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg. Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar analyses the numbers and Political Correspondent Alex Forsyth canvasses the views of people in the Peak District. From Washington, Economics Editor Faisal Islam hears the assessment of Governor of the Bank of England Mark Carney.

            <comment_content_initial>UK government has to stop favoring the terrorist country Pakistan. What is wrong with British ignoring fast developing India?
Why British favor Pakistan?
Why British government is blind? 
Are British scared of Pakistani's Terrorist's that they can attack in UK if they favour India?
Why can't the British understand that Kashmir is Acceded to India on 26/10/1947 ?
Britain can get Indians attention only if they are true to our understanding.</comment_content_initial>
