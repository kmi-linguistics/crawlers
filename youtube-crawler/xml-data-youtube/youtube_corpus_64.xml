            <video_description>Subscriber Chat Rules: No attacking other chatters or channels, if you have personal problems with other chatters, take it private between yourselves, or better to just NOT engage in conflicts in the paid chat. People are paying to be in the chat, all subscribers, VIPs and moderators are expected to be courteous, and kind to each other at all times. No spamming, no promotion of other channels unless authorized by Dutchsinse, no excessive zealotry (anti-religion or pro-religion), minimal politics, and PG13 level swearing - non-sexual, and non-racial. Try to stick on topic of earthquakes, and similar geophysics topics. Subscribers who violate chat rules will first receive ONE warning, then a time out for 10 min if it happens again, if beyond a 2nd violation, any person (moderator, vip, or paying subscriber) may be permanently banned by the channel owner / moderators.*

Marker height off the globe represents depth into the Earth.

When an earthquake strikes, you will hear a rumble, ding, and a bell toll. The bell will toll the number of times = to the earthquake which occurs. (example : M4.0 will ring 4 times).

The most recent earthquake has a green placemark / flag on it.

Blue flag / placemark = the last earthquake which was looked up

               <original_script name="Roman">Sooo much youtube drama and negativity this week, lots of channels hating on each other 😕 I think Dutch is right about the flicker rate as I have noticed my 11 yr old sons attitude changes dramatically after as little as 30 minutes of playing on his xbox, and he is only playing Minecraft !! I won’t let him play COD or games like that. Come to think of it, same thing happens after he has been on YouTube too</original_script>
