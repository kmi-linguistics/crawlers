               <original_script name="Roman">Hey....Those polls are no more believable than the polls prior to the 2016 election. The results are what the poll takers want them to be. And we NOW have a social media that explains everything anyone wants to to know about this impeachment move....so voters DON&amp;#39;T have to depend on the MSM and poll takers to decide how they&amp;#39;re going to vote in the next election. The longer this Democratic impeachment move goes on.... the more the people who voted for Donald Trump in 2016 will be pushed to vote for him again in 2020. And who cares that a % of Republicans think he should be impeached. We ALL know the Republican politicians NEVER liked Trump...and many self described Republican voters never liked Trump. He has never been considered &amp;quot;pristine&amp;quot; enough in his &amp;quot;conservative thought&amp;quot;. So HOW did he get elected? He got elected by working class Democrats...especially in those forgotten, &amp;quot;fly-over states&amp;quot;, of Wisconsin...Michigan..Ohio and Pennsylvania. THOSE are the states that appreciate what Trump has done for them and could care less what the Democrats rant, rave and stamp their feet about...concerning what they call Trump&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;crimes&amp;quot;. The &amp;quot;popular vote&amp;quot; does NOT determine who the next President will be. The electoral college votes decide that. And right now Trump holds and will likely continue to hold (no matter WHAT the Democrats try to do to him) those states that will give him a plurality of the electoral votes.</original_script>

THOSE are the states that appreciate what Trump has done for them and could care less what the Democrats rant, rave and stamp their feet about...concerning what they call Trump's &quot;crimes&quot;. The &quot;popular vote&quot; does NOT determine who the next President will be. The electoral college votes decide that. And right now Trump holds and will likely continue to hold (no matter WHAT the Democrats try to do to him) those states that will give him a plurality of the electoral votes.</comment_content_initial>

so much wasted tax money there we could replace all the streets in the entire country and feed the poor.
all they do is fight among themselves as if it’s a reality show.  this is our tax money being flushed down the toilet and they broadcast it like it’s important news.
it’s all shit. we need to take all their money away and put them in a trailer park to fight it out. what’s the difference anyway. they’re not helping us as the always claim they will but make things worse so the next donkey can claim to make things great again.....and so on.
i vote for a trailer park for former politicians.
and a new law that says they can never enter that line of work ever again.
children in a school yard get along better than they do.
how embarrassing it is for us as a nation in the eyes of the world.  no honor, no pride.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>The world needs to know this... 

Let's see... Democrat and Republican politicians have been unregulated criminals and openly criminalizing Americans and the world for at least the past 20 years.

Trump ran on draining the swamp (getting rid of the criminals) and stopping war. The criminal politicians attacked him and &quot;the deplorable americans&quot;. We are god damn good and honest Americans and we want to stop these scumb bag who have been hurting people an starting wars on purpose.

Trump won and took the corrupt Republicans out of office. So the criminals lable him unstable. Now he is investigating ONLY the CORRUPT Democrat politicians and they label him and Americans ulgy names again. He is investigating real evidence of crimes. Mean while they investigated him ILLEGALLY with no evidence of crimes, created fake documents, LIED ABOUT IT, AND DESTROYED EVIDENCE UNDER SUBPOENA. Then they say he is labels anyone criminal who runs against him... NO... He labels the damn criminals as such. These criminal politicians are people working to destroy the US for Soros and his group of elite rich communist psychopaths...

We are trying to fix America people.... And yes, we will verbally assult these POS scumb bags who think it is their right to attack us and the world. We are sick of them pushing us and the world around.

We don't hate the world or politicians.... We want freedom for everyone. We want wealth for everyone. But we won't loose our freedom to be fare... That is ignorant... We f-ing hate the criminal element in our governmen. Those who think controlling the world with a goal of Communism and taking all our freedom. Do you people dislike what our government has been doing? We do too, and we are trying to fix it.

               <original_script name="Roman">@R EE wait, let me get this straight. The Republicans that are for impeachment only hold that position to hopefully see Pelosi and Democrats hurt by a non impeachment? I&amp;#39;m sorry, but that&amp;#39;s just stupid and not politically expedient. For starters, Republicans know that challenging Trump publicly or privately WILL risk their bid at reelection, especially in strong red districts. So voting for impeachment while knowing it probably won&amp;#39;t happen as a Republican is low IQ behavior if they care about their seats. Second, publicly showing other Republicans that you&amp;#39;re defective is basically political suicide if you&amp;#39;re tasks with working with senators that support him. I&amp;#39;ll go ahead and use occam&amp;#39;s razor here and assume that breaking from Trump is either a moral stance or there&amp;#39;s a tide adjustment happening in DC. As for Pelosi, she&amp;#39;s trying to lead Democrats to control the narrative - and according to the polls, it is working, as more moderates are beginning to side with Democrats in wanting to, at the very least, hold Trump accountable for his Ukraine conversation. Pelosi knows that the senate will most likely vote to not impeach, but it&amp;#39;s all about the framing of their message and how they&amp;#39;re viewed by the public. A milquetoast, apolitical moderate is suddenly galvanized by his reckless attitude and callous approach to the office. I&amp;#39;ll just say that any Republican voting to impeach on grounds that it will hurt Pelosi more is just an idiot. If that were the case, we would have seen Trump&amp;#39;s popularity soar through the roof after the Russia investigation. We did not see that. So what justification do you have assert that this go around will be different? Might I add that the evidence we have of Trump acting inappropriately with Ukraine far exceeds what was ever introduced in the Russia fiasco.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">If you really understand the reason(s) why they&amp;#39;re wanting to impeach and tactics that follow thereafter, assuming they&amp;#39;re scared is just dumb. Pelosi isn&amp;#39;t a moron; she&amp;#39;s fully aware the Senate will most likely vote not to impeach, however if public sentiment continues to shift around impeachment and removal (51% in favor by way of a Fox News poll), the public will view the senate as increasingly more responsible for the erosion of the rule of law and ethical standards regarding the office - quite damning for a party that lives and dies off the whole &amp;quot;law and order&amp;quot; thing. Moreover, there are defective Republicans that are causing a rift between them and Trump&amp;#39;s &amp;quot;us vs. them&amp;quot; camp. Even more, moderates are polling in favor of impeachment now, that&amp;#39;s why the amount of people for impeachment has continued to swell. All of this is political chess and Pelosi is winning, as much as Republicans don&amp;#39;t want to admit that. Let&amp;#39;s not even talk about the fact that this is all unfolding as we approach 2020.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">BBC, you are completely corrupt, and dishonest, in keeping salient facts and information from the public. What you haven&amp;#39;t told everyone, is that this is NOT an &amp;quot;official&amp;quot; impeachment inquiry, it is an &amp;quot;internal&amp;quot; democrat only inquiry, because Schiff and Pelosi are afraid to go through the proper procedure, because this would allow the Trump administration to present their evidence to the public, and the Democrats want to keep everything behind closed doors. In other words this is a Kangaroo court. The other reason for republicans wanting a full impeachment inquiry too is because they&amp;#39;re saying &amp;quot;bring it on&amp;quot;, let&amp;#39;s have a proper &amp;quot;official hearing&amp;quot;, because they know that the evidence, witnesses, and sworn affidavits that Trumps lawyer has, is devastating to the Bidens and DNC. Why can&amp;#39;t you just tell the truth instead of these constant lies?</original_script>

The Democrats whistle-blower phonecall story is dead in the water. The investigation into the Biden's Ukrainian fraud deals reopened February 2019. That's well before the Trump call. That's even before this President of Ukraine was even elected.

Here are some marvellous quotes by the man himself!

2015:
&quot;I would rarely leave the White House because there's so much work to be done&quot;.

&quot;I would not be a president who took vacations. I would not be a president that takes time off&quot;.

2016:
&quot;I'm going to be working for you. I'm not going to have time to go play golf&quot;.

The facts speak for themselves, you're just lying to yourself.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">It is amazing to me how you leave out the fact that the transcript of the phone call was released. That Adam Schit has been caught in numerous lies and met with the &amp;quot;Democrat Blower&amp;quot; prior to the story breaking. Also the blower worked with Biden in the past at a high level. Hmm, you forgot that Hunter Biden took huge amounts of money from a Ukraine company while knowing zero about financial investment. You also missed that Biden also took a large sum of money from that very same Ukraine Company, the same folks who shared interest in firing the prosecuter. The amazing thing is that there&amp;#39;s damning video evidence of Biden and his collusion with the Ukraine government but apparently that doesn&amp;#39;t exist in &amp;quot;Democrat World&amp;quot;. You also forgot that all Trump wants is a vote to legitimize the impeachment charges against him. The reason Adam Schit and speaker in name only, Nancy Pelosi, won&amp;#39;t call for a vote is because contrary to your pole numbers, it wouldn&amp;#39;t pass. Then there&amp;#39;s the Senate which would surely vote against it. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;BBC you forgot a lot of things with this video. One thing though that you should remember is that Donald Trump is the President of the United States and will continue to be through till 2024. That is about the only truthful fact when it comes to those shifty, lying, Dems. Sound familiar.</original_script>
