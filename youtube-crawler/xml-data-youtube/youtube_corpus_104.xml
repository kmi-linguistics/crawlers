            <video_title>Hong Kong scraps law that sparked protests  - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Hong Kong's legislature has formally withdrawn a controversial extradition bill that has sparked months of unrest.

The bill - which would have allowed for criminal suspects to be extradited to mainland China - prompted outrage when it was introduced in April.

Hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and the bill was eventually suspended.

But protesters have continued regular demonstrations, which spiralled into a wider pro-democracy movement.

Know to not just trust one newssource. Know that Chinese police have been using chemical weapons that killed multiple animals including cats and dogs. Know that this is a war on the freedom of Hong Kong. Know that the Chinese police have been using chemical weapons and violence on press and bystanding civilians. Know to think critically on things that Chinese media claims about the protests. It is a dangerous world out there but will be more dangerous if Hong Kong loses this war.

               <original_script name="Roman">I am a Hongkonger.  My whole family lives in Hong Kong for more than 100 years.  Hong Kong has democracy, our democracy is different from western.  Our democracy is called hyperdemocracy.  Look！Those rioters beat up polices, destroyed police station, destroyed public facilities, one of the polices’ finger was bitten off by a rioter and the rioter damaged one of the police’s bollock, chopped a Police, burned a police, beat up ordinary innocent Hongkongers.  Can anyone ask the Human right organization to stop those rioters to destroy Hong Kong and stop them bullying Hong Kong ordinary people and polices.  Hong Kong police officers are Hong Kong People too.  Hong Kong Polices worked non-stop 36 hours for those rioters day by day, under the hot sun, around 30 degrees. Now, Hong Kong people look at those rioters (protesters) in disgust.  Hong Kong people call them Cockroaches.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those so called protesters, in fact that they were rioters.  And those rioters were engaging some events, they called it “ Nang Chow “ not Chowmein (Chinese style fried noodle).  The meaning of Nang Chow is to make any misinformation and lie in order to continually create chaos in Hong Kong.  Some of the rioters were paid to make those chaos and instigate the others.  And some of the youths was brainwashed.  I just watched Cult in Explain from Netflix. Almost the same as what is happening in HK.  Some youths said if they did not go protesting, they would be bullied by their peer, they have peer pressure. And the leaders of the riot kept promoting the belief of value judgement rather than a constructive work.  Their dear leaders of the riot keep doing the soft sell to those youths.  And they used enormous lies to create an Enemy, they see polices, government are their enemy. The rioters and the leaders tried very hard to damage the reputation of Hong Kong Police Force.  Some youths even departed from their family to be rioters.  They do not listen their family anymore.  Their dear leaders of the riot keep telling those youths the New Reality and promoting more violence. What the heck of this?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;US and England invaded Iraq in 2003. Media goes silent afterwards. And enormous misleading and fake news were spreading around the world like a wave.  Look at Iraq today.  And I learnt something “Never ever take the side of the outsiders against your own government”.  &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Those rioters (so called protesters) said they have set up a new government in Hong Kong and those rioters are the police force in Hong Kong now.  And all the Hong Kong people’s assets are belong to them.  They are really retarted!!! The biggest joke in this century, they really a joke!&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Hong Kong was a peaceful place.  China government and Mainland Chinese very mush respect Hong Kong and Hong Kong people. The unemployment rate of Hong Kong before the unrest was 2.8%,  According to the  economics, It is called fully employment.  2.8% was a friction rate.  And our rating of S&amp;amp;P was AA+.  It is true the youths were not easy to buy a house in Hong Kong.  However, the housing problem was in all the countries around the world, not only Hong Kong.  Please dig up your memory, who creates this freaking quantitative easing.  The whole true behind the unrest was somebody tried very hard to not let our Government to build more public housing and the foreign force does not like the extradition.  The whole true behind the extradition is a woman was killed by her bf in Taiwan.  Taiwan urged HK Government to send back that freaking guy to Taiwan.  Taiwan urged Hong Kong three times.  That freaking murder is in Hong Kong now, and was released.  Without the extradition, HK government is no way to send him to Taiwan for hearing.  And the foreign force sees it as an entry point to make this freaking chaos in Hong Kong.  As I said my whole family lives in HK for more than 100 years.  Thus, I need to make sure everyone realised the true of the chaos in Hong Kong.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">You made a very basic mistake. Believe me, most people in Hong Kong don’t identify with Chinese at all. There is something wrong about their sense of identity cuz they have long been colonized and exposed to western culture and western-style governance, which is totally different from mainland China, where has the deepest convention of totalitarian. But we Chinese citizens cannot accept any kind of separatist because we have the longest history as a unified country, which is considered as one the supreme value in our culture. If looking back into our history, it will be very clear that we started so many wars against separation resolutely. Generally, we are very mild, but when it comes to war against separation, Chinese men will go to the front zone without second thought, even giving their lives.

            <comment_content_initial>@Dušan Xmetov Which is why extradition laws exist, so that anyone has to be tried in their own country first.
In fact, you don't have to be an authoritarian regime to call anyone &quot;an Enemy of the People&quot;.
Meng Wanzhou, Julian Assange and Edward Snowden have all been called 'an Enemy of the People' and all of them have been sought extradition for.
And they were highly sought for unlike Chan-Tong kai.
So now we have a Taiwanese government and a Hong Kong crowd that doesn't want a murderer be brought to justice for choking his girlfriend to death and dumping her body in a ditch for cheating, while Canada wants to extradite a lady to the US for answering &quot;no&quot; to a question asked in Singapore about a Malaysian company involved in transferring money to Iran via an Emirate payment processer that has a server in the US and therefore the US government finds it justified that she commited a crime in the US.</comment_content_initial>

Don't think for a moment that this is a CCP problem, ... no not so..... not a Chinese problem per se, at all.
What we see here, is what will always happen when very powerful states, come into being....
Central planning, central control, codification of decisions, and the inevitable centralised garnering of people's resources via taxation lead to a cacophony of powerful interests, focusing on a tiny goal.
Western countries, like Australia, USA, the Americas and Europe north and south etc have grappled with this growing problem, all this time, pretty much unsuccessfully.....
When a state becomes powerful enough, its leaders move from being covert Narcissists to overt Narcissists, and the decline to psychopathy can be very rapid. 
Look out and be warned.

               <original_script name="Roman">@Dario Sting You just ignored everything I said. Answer my questions, which Chinese city was better than Hong Kong before 1997? &lt;br /&gt;Hong Kong has protests every single year ever since the handover, getting bigger and bigger and their poverty is by far the worst ever since the handover.&lt;br /&gt;You proved my first comment correct, China ruined HK in just a short time. The wonderful city under British rule that gave us Bruce Lee, John Wu, amazing cinema and Hong Kong culture. The famous prospering city, despite being so small, totally ruined by China.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Josh Borat You do know that the reason law was put in the first place because a citizen of HK committed murder of his girlfriend and his unborn child in Taiwan, and after coming to HK, he admitted his crime. Since it was in Taiwan, ONLY TAIWAN can prosecute him, not HK. So HK decided to put the extradition bill to make that happen. I mean, dude killed his UNBORN CHILD! The reason why protest began was bcs some fool said Chinese will use that bill to enslave HK -.- It&amp;#39;s not like HK will become part of China in 2047 -.-</original_script>

Since it was in Taiwan, ONLY TAIWAN can prosecute him, not HK. So HK decided to put the extradition bill to make that happen. I mean, dude killed his UNBORN CHILD! The reason why protest began was bcs some fool said Chinese will use that bill to enslave HK -.- It's not like HK will become part of China in 2047 -.-</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>「＆＾３　輪廻転生」
中国と香港の問題はチベットが鍵となると仮に仮定して考えた。

中国がチベットを弾圧するのはチベット医学の流出を防ぐ為と輪廻転生の考えを存続する為？

輪廻転生についてどう考えてる？

産まれたばかりの頃は誰もが年寄りの精神を持っているが次第にそれは薄れて行く。そう私は感じている。

話しが長くなるから、一言だと、

輪廻転生は永遠に続く経験値が増えていく作業。一人ではないんだ。それぞれ名前を得て経験していくけれど、同じ人物ではないんだ。

イタリア語と日本語で説明するとね、

ｄａｒｅ（イタリア語）＝与えるという意味だけれど、日本語でその言葉の音を聞くと、ｄａｒｅ（日本語）＝誰

に変化するんだ。その繰り返しが輪廻転生という意味なんだよ。

もし、あなたが理解できるととあなたの見えている世界のこだわりがなくなると思うな。だれ＝ｄａｒｅ＝誰＝ｃｈｉ＝気　言葉と音は楽しむべきだよ。

The problem of China and Hong Kong was assumed assuming that Tibet is the key.

Is China repressing Tibet to prevent the outflow of Tibetan medicine and to keep the idea of ​​reincarnation?

What do you think about reincarnation?

When we were born, everyone has an elderly spirit, but it gradually fades away. So i feel.

Because the talk will be long, in a word,

Reincarnation is a work that increases the experience that lasts forever. I'm not alone. Each gets their name and experiences, but they are not the same person.

If you explain in Italian and Japanese,

Dare (Italian) = Gives it, but when you hear the sound of the word in Japanese, dare (Japanese) = Who

It changes to. That repetition means reincarnation.

If you can understand, you won't lose your commitment to the world you see. Who = dare = who = chi = ki You should enjoy words and sounds.

Absolutely awesome. in the US, the cops shoot and kill innocent civilians for minor errors or mostly for no reason. So all in all Chinese Central Government should be respected and commended for their professional, humane, and civilized way of tackling this idiotic , dumb, ignorant behavior of   the few hong kong chines community, Who think their way of thinking is far more superior than any chinese.

For more about the murders which officials are calling &amp;quot;suicides&amp;quot; go to a youtube channel called Voice of Guo media he is a former CCP member who lives in the US now.

            <comment_content_initial>@9871ification 
For 99% of poor Tibetians who have live under serfdom and the oppression of superstitous belief rather than modern science and technology, it is for Tibetians themselves to decide whether a society build upon modern economic principles is better or one based on ancient religion of a spiritual leader reincarnate.


If you think the occupation of Tibet and Xinjiang is akin to the Japanese occupation of Asia based on carnage, rape and pilferage, then you are mistaken. China has plans to turn this states into economic success and not to diminish the states into perpetual servitude states  i.e. &quot;Polands&quot; during Soviet era.


That's why there are education camps which are actually training institutes to equip poor farmers with skills that are required in nation building. Farmers no longer have to live according to the weather patterns dictated by the &quot;gods&quot; but have a stable income afforded by modern living. 


With large scale mechanisation of the farms, labour is freed up to other sectors of the economy. And unemployed monks and religious students can be deployed to do productive work that alleviate poverty. Instead of praying for a miracle.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@momo lolo You still haven&amp;#39;t understand my argument, this is my third time repeating it.

These countries have bad governance rather the system itself which is my point at the end. As you have said that they are trying to getting rid of oppositions, this means that the government is not focusing on what the citizen wants, it was trying to get rid of the opposition! One of the good example of a country that has barely functioning opposition (base on the democratic index publish by the west) but a good governance is Singapore. Despite they have gerrymandering and a bad treatment towards opposition and the media, the government has proven they are the trustee for the people, the last government corruption case that has came up seems to be in the 1980s from what I know of.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Regarding to your suggestions on having a &amp;#39;true&amp;#39; election and allowing the opposition from the Legco win. A clear example would be Taiwan and the most recent Malaysia. After Taiwan has allow free elections in the 1990s with the pressure of the US government, all I have experience was basically 1) the existing government getting rid of pervious government policies, and vice versa after each 5 years term limit 2)The two parties are attempting to eradicate each other. At the end who benefits, I don&amp;#39;t believe much of the citizens benefit. These parties are only making policies for short term and attempting to fulfill the needs of a small group of population rather while sacrificing the countries long term development.

It is &amp;#39;mandatory&amp;#39; because it is the culture a western democracy in general, where it is required to step down when doing something wrong. That is why culture exist, even in politics, because every country is different.

Firstly, what do you mean by Fake news? Does a news that doesn&amp;#39;t align with your news means fake news? I do not know any of a leader in an asian democratic country that is willing to step down because of peoples protest (rather than because of the pressure of the west, rather than because of the lost of support in the military and the cabinet), that is why I want you to point out.

*I have know nothing much about Mao, so I can't comment much on it.


**Can you point out that a leader in 'democratic' country in Asia would is willing to step down because of peoples protest (rather than because of the pressure of the west, rather than because of the lost of support in the military and the cabinet). As I do not find your arguments persuasive!

About the &quot;stepping down&quot; of leaders in Asian countries, its not really a culture, its mandatory step for a country to not to be wrecked by unecessary protests, riots and rebellions. The &quot;culture of stepping down&quot; is a hoax by created by dictators who didn't want to step down peacefully.

Even if the leader isn't willing to step down, the cabinet will force him/her to, refusing to cooperate with the unworthy leader.

There is way lesser reason for a capable leader to not to step down in a democratic country.

There are many democratic countries in Asia who has leaders willing to step down, I live in one of them as well. It just fake news has greatly influenced your mind and your spirit.</comment_content_initial>

1.The leader is part of the system as well, a leader without a system might as well as a nobody. For example, a chieftain of a primitive tribe is just another nobody, if there isn't any kind Hierachy system in the tribe at all. A leader must rely on his/her subordinates in order to rule effectively, therefore in the end of the day, no matter how heroic the leaders are, they have to rely on the system in order to rule properly. 

Without allowing any kind of opposition in a party/ parliament, leaderships tend to be corrupt fast since its much easier to secure one's position without much effort and negative consequences. For example, India, Sri Lanka and Bangladesh have a rather low efficiency in terms of democracy, its due to the fact that their ruling party has a habit of physically crushing other parties from participating the general election. Their aim is to destroy the democratic system, then establish a fake democracy where there is only one ruling party, like CCP. Democracy has failed in these places, due to massive corruption within the leadership.

Overtime, due to over-centralization of power, the government will got less inclined to rule properly, since the risks of not ruling properly are at the lowest when there's no criticism from the oppositions at all. If this keeps going on without any reforms or true general elections or politicians stepping down, sooner or later the people will soon rebel and attempt overrun the government by force, further wrecking the country. Most of the time, the military will take this as an advantage to &quot;fight for the people&quot; since they have all the equipments to rebel, like how Qing dynasty has fallen.

Regarding the Legco, that is how every congress and parliament in the world works, whether its democratic or authoritian regime. Either ruling/opposition, factions/parties will attempt to obstruct certain bills that will certainly benefit the people. To counter those disadvantages, its very simple, they have to held a true general election. Let the troublemaking party win the election, let them in charge of many controversial bills, broken their fancy promises, lost their voters' trust then badabing badaboom! More true voters for the previous ruling party! The end result is, the people will get more matured in voting and political matters, and the ruling/opposition party wouldn't dare to screw around so much anyone.

The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The terms cannot be renegotiated in the middle of a contract using violence without consequence. Obviously, the current environment does not fulfill such prerequisite.

You can't talk to an international audience(which a YouTube comment section is) about how the CCP has &quot;lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty&quot; without the claim being heavilly misunderstood to be much more than it actually is. The claim itself is obfuscatory by nature.

So, when defending the Chinese government against accusations of authoritarian abuse made by members of the international community, you can't simultaneously use a metric such as &quot;poverty&quot;, and also say that international interpretations of such a metric are unimportant.

This is an example of the duel definition fallacy. You can't use China's definition of poverty to get the statistic and then present the statistic to western nations as an example of how China is performing in comparison to those nations.

You say that China doesn't want to be the west, but they DO want to compare themeselves to the west in ways that make their system appear to be succeeding more, and by the same metrics.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">Matt Doak Thank you for your in-depth response. However the only point I see that you are trying to make is a comparison between US and China. As you stated “western standards”. But you see China is not the west and they are not trying to be. Nor do they try to push their ways and methods on the west. The numbers you stated may be true and a beggar on the street could possibly make more than the average Chinese worker but the cost of living is also much lower in China.
