            <video_title>Brexit: PM sends EU unsigned request seeking Brexit delay - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Boris Johnson has sent a request to the EU for a delay to Brexit - but without his signature.

The request was accompanied by a second letter, signed by Mr Johnson, which says he believes that a delay would be a mistake.

The PM was required by law to ask the EU for an extension to the 31 October deadline after losing a Commons vote.

EU Council President Donald Tusk tweeted that he had received the extension request.

He did not provide details of its content, but added that he will now consult EU leaders &quot;on how to react&quot;.

Hours after losing a crunch vote in a historic Saturday session in the House of Commons, the prime minister ordered a senior diplomat to send an unsigned photocopy of the call by MPs set out in the so-called Benn Act, passed last month.

            <comment_content_initial>Democracy is dead and being replaced by United Nations traitors working 
at a local level across our land and in all the other countries in the 
world.
We won't get brexit because the globalist elite have decided we won't have it.
What you WILL have is forced 'smart cities' and people being made to share or give up their cars.
Greening over our streets is up and running already in some city centres ( Sheffield for one example ) and they won't stop.
People can carry on believing the phoney left-right/Labour-Tory paradigm
 for as long as they want, but it won't make a jot of difference unless 
people wake up to what is REALLY going on.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Robertt Avro The (scant) majority of the Brits WANTED to get out in 2016, after the Two Clowns spent months telling them how wonderful it would be, carefully omitting all bad consequences and obstacles -- such as the GFA.  If even 4% of those who voted for Brexit on that occasion have now changed their mind, or just want to see a solution to those problems before the exit is consumed, then forcing Brexit now, with no such solution, would be totaly anti-democratic.  &lt;br /&gt;Since you say that you still want Brexit, please explain what you want to happen to Northern Ireland.  Should there be a hard border between it and Ireand, or a hard border between it and the rest of the UK?  And should Scotland and Wales be forced to leave the EU against the will of their majority, just because the majority of the English wanted to leave?</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Jorge Stolfi Sorry, but I completely disagree with you. I believe the majority wants out of this union as per the national vote, and I certainly know I do. In my mind I want out of it first, then everything else can follow. It&amp;#39;s like a bad marriage and divorce, yes it will be somewhat painful but needs to be ended. &lt;br /&gt;Everything else is just stalling tactics.  If you really think people don&amp;#39;t want Brexit then call a General Election with each politician clearly stating their Brexit platform (which are basically already known). A new parliament based on the issue at hand. But of course remainers don&amp;#39;t want that because they will most likely lose. They just want to stall and stall and stall, throwing in more and more details to try and delay, extend, gum up the works so it can&amp;#39;t get done, and they get their way. Regardless, I can see there is no further use debating with you, because nothing you can say will change my mind and you probably feel the same way. But for me, I want out.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Jorge Stolfi Yeah....no thanks, by having another referendum we would be acting in an anti democratic manner since the decision has already been made by a clear majority of the electorate.  Stop trying to  overturn a democratically made decision of the whole voting populace. Why should we do that? Get it done first, then call an election. NO to yet more stalling tactics and NO to more EU control of England.  &lt;br /&gt;We fought the largest war in human history to ensure there would be no German control of Europe and an independent Britain. And when citizens realized how controlling and dictatorial the EU was becoming we voted to get out. We want out of the damnable institution and we want it done now! Everything else is secondary to that key point.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Robertt Avro The question is whether the public will know what Brexit means when they vote.  Boris wants the general election now because he hopes that people will still think that it means the bullshit that he and Nigel told them, and that Labour is to blame for its delay.  A new referendum on Brexit would have to come with a better explanation of what it means -- including how the North Ireland issue would be solved.  Boris does not want that, because he has no acceptable solution for that problem, and knows that there cannot be one.</original_script>

Although appreciated the get up and go of Boris, its a breath of fresh air, I hope he goes for the clean break now. The mess we are in has been caused by Labour, Lib Dems, and a few tory rebels, labour even want to sack the queen, they should be locked up in mental institutions, along with lib dems, greens and all other tatterdemalions</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>I don’t understand why parties supporting remaining are so inapt at selling their message. Haven’t they learned anything from Leave campaign’s win.

Make it an easy to digest statement:

“Back to Britain”

Start whaling on the Conservatives and Brexit party and the like for having dragged the country into 3 years of inapt politics talking about brexit but not delivering a single thing. And particularly on having abandoned all other issues facing the British people. That by doing so they “Have left the British people in the cold”.

Keep pounding on the fact that deal or no-deal it’s still years and decades of endless negotiations and infighting to come (paint that picture of despair).

Then offer your great solution again:

Back to Britain

We’re going to focus on Britain again and solving its issues - not on the EU and creating more issues. We’re going to be talking about the British people, not the EU. We’re going to get all this madness over and done with. Back to Britain!</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">Boris Johnson thwarted?  This has laid bare to all voters how much the remainer MPs have lied.  The deal met all the oppositions demands except remain.  So they have shown themselves to all be ardent remainers and nothing else.  That means that most voters now trust the conservatives far more than labour, lib Dems,  etc.  While SNP has shown how embarrassingly pathetic they are to the Scots by throwing a tantrum that Johnson did not give them the same deal as Northern Ireland.  That means that the next government is a majority conservative one.</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>BREXIT DEAL - EU still controls UK's trade deals and has Primacy with EU law over more-or-less everything the UK wishes to do with trade et al, so what’s the point?

The problem with BREXIT is that the people do not get the full facts from the media or from our politicians; whether that is due to ignorance I am not sure, but the people need to know the other side of the story or otherwise they too are politically ignorant. 

(1) For when you look into the text of the Brexit Treaty all other negotiated ‘free trade’ deals agreed from around the world gives the EU powers to stop any trade deal if it is disadvantageous and detrimental to the EU. Therefore we have not achieved ‘free trade’ deals at all in reality with this Treaty unless the EU allows them and where specifically the UK has no economic advantage over the EU. So I say make ready for challenge after challenge by the EU under this Treaty and where trade deal after trade deal will be totally open to prolongation and stopped if the EU sees that they are economically disadvantaged...and they will. 

(2) But added to this fact under the Treaty, primacy will be given to EU Law, tying all other trade agreements ultimately with the EU disadvantage mandate and which will be signed into EU law under the Treaty. Indeed, this fact was reinforced by the Rt Hon Ann Widdecombe the former Home Secretary on Friday 18 October 2019 when interviewed by Kirsty Wark on the BBC’s flagship political programme ‘Newsnight’. - https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/m0009dr7/newsnight-18102019

And that is the crux of the whole matter, for whoever controls the law, controls everything

               <original_script name="Roman">Boris will do the right thing and get Great Britain out of the EU. At least he stands for principles, going against any delay which will make Britain a bigger circus then it already is. Whereas Corbyn and many like him are spineless and stand for nothing but themselves. Boris will make Britain a tech hub of the world with cutting edge innovation taking place here in the UK and exporting those ideas and products to the world. The Remainers should just back Boris now and respect democracy. And I find it treacherous how most of the Remainers walk around with the EU flag instead of showing the Union Jack. A complete lack of respect for Britain’s sovereignty.</original_script>

How many rich middle class ponces from the home counties who are not affected by inner city immigration?
How many violent Marxist revolutionaries who want a bloody uprising?
I wonder who they all are, too.
The patience of the LEAVE voters has been admirable.
Maybe it will have to end if we are sold out?

They would then be able to instigate martial law.

            <comment_content_initial>No deal/crash out/clean break brexit first week;

 Day one: The leave lot celebrate, the value of the sterling drops dramatically.

Day two: Government raise taxes, the leave lot realise there is no going back to talks with the EU as they are a competitor now and blame the remain people.

Day three: Without access to EU trade routes and no trade deals finalized with anyone else food, medicine and other supplies begin to run low, stockpiling occurs.

Day four: businesses finalize their relocation resulting in high unemployment and homelessness.

Day five: recession in full swing, a mass emigration occurs increasing taxes resulting in an extremely top heavy population.

Day six: civil unrest as the leavers become violent like rabid dogs biting at anyone or anything. November 6th the PM goes to court gets off on fabricated technicalities.

Day seven: the dup are kicked out of ignored northern Ireland, the mistreated Scotland makes for independence. Britain falls apart but most importantly humbled and everyone is better off.(apart the people now dead or homeless)</comment_content_initial>

He did not sign the letter, and he wrote accompanying letters to weaken the Benn act letter. That is forbidden by the British Supreme court. It would be very strange to see a PM arrested for contempt of court (and parliament) without parliament being able to fire him. I think the Brexit is an impossible project that overstretches what a modern democratic administration can do in peacetime. I have said that all along. The whole referendum was impossible.

               <original_script name="Roman">@Peter Fysh saying people lied isn&amp;#39;t enough, you have to veritably prove that it affected the way they voted. Then you have to make sure the other side isn&amp;#39;t guilty of the same thing. Like remainers saying there will be world war 3, a recession etc. Then you have to base that on current polling which shows leave has increased 2% from 52% to 54%. So if after 3 years you believe more information has become available which changes things in favour of remain we would see that change in the polling data.</original_script>

You are not obligated to get a quick response to them especially if your members can’t come to a unanimous decision.  Parliament will be forced to vote “deal or no deal” in the final hours.....they will go for the deal.  They  are too chicken to go for no deal.  Parliament fell into BoJos trap.

            <comment_content_initial>*The reality...*

People voted leave for reasons that were bigoted and/or grossly uninformed.

Now that the reality of leaving has become apparent, there is a perfectly democratic case for going back to the public, presenting the reality of leaving and the damage it will do to the union and the economy, and asking if we still want this.

There's only one reason to be against this exercise in democracy, which is people afraid of the result.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Yoruichi The Extra Terrestrial and what I&amp;#39;m saying is if you have a second referendum the majority will be remain not because the will of the people has changed but because the people who choose leave before have given up on democracy and will not vote, why put your time in a system that has done everything it can to weasel its way out of a majority decision. Of course the lefties will spin it with some kind of bs like people have become &amp;#39;enlightened&amp;#39;  and now love the EU ignoring the huge difference between the large  number of people that voted before and the few that voted now. Then weak labour MPs will go on their hands and knees to the EU saying please can we revoke article 50. EU will say yes as long as you become full members ie give up the pound and any other independence you currently have oh and you won&amp;#39;t be one of the top three anymore get down there with Greece so you can have even less say in the ruling of your country. Labour will jump at this not even putting it to a vote saying the second referendum justify this, even though their will be rioting in the streets. Loving the fact that the MPs can go back to being paid over £100,000 a year but not having to run a country, just copy and paste from the EU. The economy will suffer because the UK will be either be viewed as weak or unreliable so businesses will move away from trading here. Que a large depression in which another large EU country will lend the UK money same as Germany did to Greece forever keeping the UK in debt and chaining them to the Eu, then you will have a National socialist party come along which will gather momentum as people have lost faith in the current forms of government for &amp;#39;selling us out&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;ignoring the peoples vote&amp;#39;  rise to power leading to heavy censorship of the news and propaganda to brainwash the youth blaming a group for all the countries problems.

            <comment_content_initial>@Peregrine Slim 

He sent the letter as he was advised to do but there wasn't a stipulation in the Benn Act that states that he should sign it.
Unless you can point out to me where it is?
As for the referendum being advisory, yes it was but article 50 was invoked by a majority in the house. If it's so easy why don't you petition your MP to revoke article 50? It probably wouldn't be a good idea though because even the staunch remainers know they haven't got the numbers to push that one through.
Boris is elected because he's an MP and as I said earlier if you have problems with Boris being an unelected Prime Minister then again I'd advise you to petition your MP to push for a general election.
And remind me again who was the Prime Minister who allowed the referendum in the first place, it wasn't Johnson and you'll find that that Prime Minister was elected.</comment_content_initial>

The Benn Bill stated that the Prime Minister had to send the letter relating to the extension if a deal hadn't been passed by 19/10/19 which he has done.
As for him being unelected?
That also applies to Major, Brown and May who all assumed office without an election.

               <original_script name="Roman">@Skylie Skye Boris is in no way similar to Hitler, you people should be ashamed of yourselves, you are trivializing the true horrors of fascism by comparing everything you disagree with as Fascist or Nazi. Just Fuck off with that rhetoric, we are sick of you people labeling everything and trying to shut down all conversation with this crap. When you need to resort to insults and call into question people&amp;#39;s character you have lost the argument, you should be able to argue your point in a coherent and sensible manner the reason you can&amp;#39;t is because you know that you are wrong and cannot organise your thoughts in a manner that makes sense of what you think is true. If you think Boris &amp;amp; Trump are bad then you have no idea what is coming, if the left within the western world does not come back to the centre you may very well end up creating the new Hitler, or the new Stalin if they aren&amp;#39;t pulled back to the middle. you are already seeing the beginning of the people&amp;#39;s discontent in the form of Brexit and the populist governments springing up all over the western world and it&amp;#39;s only going to get worse.</original_script>

            <comment_content_initial>@skill centre I can tell from your language and attitude that you don't mind bending over for UNELECTED bureaucrats from another country  ... a referendum is at least carried out for and by citizens. 

Just because you don't like the democratic outcome doesn't make it a lie ... it just means you didn't get your way and your response is like a child throwing your toys out of the cot and a big dummy spit.

All future candidates who are going to represent the British people should be scrutinised &amp;amp; undergo an extensive police screening &amp;amp; and a MI6 Intelligence clearance. These measures will reduce or cut out all the dead wood, bad apples, double agents, self serving political profiteers. After we have left the germanic eu bable juggernaut.

            <comment_content_initial>ybbok - as the moronic tusk said &quot; there is a special place in hell.......&quot; was he referring to the hell in our house of commons or the house of lords! Frankly if you ask me the latter should be disbanded &amp; the former needs a thorough sanitising, march out the germanic nazi collaborators to Tower of london to be executed. All future candidates who are going to represent the British people should be scrutinised &amp; undergo an extensive police screening &amp; and a MI6 Intelligence clearance. These measures will reduce or cut out all the dead wood, bad apples, double agents, self serving political profiteers. After we have left the germanic eu bable juggernaut. They should introduce a bill to bring the death penalty only for treason, collaboration &amp; collution  with a foreign nation. His is to be called &quot; Hanging by Big Ben&quot;</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>Once upon a time, if you voted against someone like Obama or Tony Blair in Britain, you simply accepted your loss and moved on. 
Those days are indeed properly for story books which begin – “Once Upon a Time.” 

This is not something which is unique to Britain. 
We are beginning to see the collapse of civilization which will only end in separatist movements and violence.
People are no longer willing to accept democracy. 
If they lose, they are turning much more violent demanding their way or no way. 

Pro-BREXIT British MPs had to be escorted from Parliament by police to protect them from violence. Despite the fact that the people voted for BREXIT, the opposition REFUSES to accept that decision.

We are witnessing plain intolerance rising on a massive scale. 

Democracy is dead.

We have protests rising around the globe against the status quo. It is both sides of the political issues. 
In Maryland, USA there was a sign posted that said:
 “Hey Liberals Better get your guns if you try to impeach President Trump.” 

There is simply a real hatred that is brewing and like the genie in a bottle, there is no way to put it all back. 
This simply has to play itself out and it will NOT END WELL!!! 

Neither side is going to convince the other that their way of thinking should prevail.

The very purpose of civilization is when everyone comes together to produce a society that is greater than the sum of the individuals. 
We have lost that very purpose. 

I honestly do not know what the future will bring but there will have to be a lot of blood spilled before there will ever be any resolution. 
The hatred is far too great to overcome.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Joe shmoe Well maybe i&amp;#39;m mistaken, but how i understand it, it keeps Northern Ireland more aligned with the EU. That&amp;#39;s why you need checks in the irish sea to make sure nothing can cross over to mainland britain from the eu or the other way arround.&lt;br /&gt;So it is better in the question of the good friday agreement, since there is no boarder in Ireland.&lt;br /&gt;It is worse if you wanted a clean cut from the EU, since this deal ties NI to the EU while seperating it from the rest of britain.</original_script>

(which is probably a great way to fasten the reunification of ireland, and fules the fire under another Scottish indipendence referendum)

If it is better to stay, then would would someone want the rest of the UK to leave at all?
Or are you against all Unions not just the european ones and want to break up the UK?
In that case this deal is just great.</comment_content_initial>

Sure Churchill stood up to face the foe,  but last time i checked, the allied forces won that war not the britsh alone.
Which should remind people, that we are stronger together.
Or do you realy think britain could have stood on it's own without help back then?


Oh and just one fun fact:

So to be honest. I would rather have the UK leave sooner than later, but i want the UK to have a safe ride along the way.
The referendum was held, the decision was made and then began a process.
All i'm saying is:
As long es Brexit is not stoped, the result of the referendum is still honored. So it is still democracy. Slow and painful, but democracy.

If we get back to politics using your analogy.
In the case of the LibDems under Cable and more recently Swinson.
They have no intention of going to Disneyland and wish to basically stay at home and keep the status quo negating any promises that parliament made about seeing Mickey and Minnie.
Others like Dominic Grieve and Anna Sourbry represent constituents that voted to leave and stood on mandates to uphold the referendum. So they promised that they'd agree to go and see Pluto and Goofy but have now said that they are not going because they also prefer to stay at home.
So the conclusion would be that they promised Disneyland but decided to stay at home, the car couldn't get stuck in a traffic jam because they had no intention of letting it leave the driveway.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>Boris Johnson will face contempt of court proceedings next week after sending not one, but two letters to the European Union tonight following yet another parliamentary defeat over the ‘Letwin amendment’.

The Letwin motion required him to do so in order to allow all legislation relating to his deal to be passed before the deal is formalised.

Johnson sent an unsigned letter to the EU via a diplomat to ask for an extension – while sending a signed letter telling the EU that to grant one would be ‘deeply corrosive’:</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">This Parliament was elected before Referendum, clearly they took their stands against people&amp;#39;s vote. So they must go away. The Queen need to save Britain from such stalemate situation and help Britain to cross over the blockage. If this parliament is broken, there will be another General Election where MPs will be elected based on their promises on Brexit to British People. These MPs are abusing their authority making harmful laws to bind PM and other Officers who are trying to prepare Britain to get ready for post Brexit Britain. We must get rid off them, get rid off all of them.</original_script>

If you are thinking that the Conservative MPs or the ERG members would stand alongside the general public who voted Leave in 2016 you are mistaken. 
The poorest regions in the North and in Wales had more Leave voters but the Tory/ERG Government would never stand by your side to support you and the millions who voted for Brexit.

Just ask them and find out where you stand, they would rather cross the street than look a poverty stricken person in the eye.</comment_content_initial>

The 2016 EU referendum should never have been held. It went ahead and again the result was rigged the campaigns put out disinformation and lies, they overspent, they manipulated the voters, divided the nation, the bad boys of Brexit bank rolled dark ads and made huge profits on the side when the pound tanked. 
The Governments own select report into the #BrexitCrimeScene was published in 2018. 

Brexit was never going to solve any of the problems present in the UK. 
⚠️8.4m struggling to eat 
⚠️1.9m OAPs in poverty 
⚠️1m waiting for social housing 
⚠️4.1m children in poverty 
⚠️1m+ Foodbank users 
⚠️8m work-age adults in poverty
⚠️165% rough sleeping hike  
It is the current Government that is behind these issues, the current Tory/ERG that was behind the Vote Leave lies. Only a United UK can solve these issues with a Government that works for everyone not just the wealthy and the super rich, or the Eton and Oxford educated.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>@Elaine Stewart Did they vote on how to leave? No?
Then it is parliaments job to work that out.
It`s called representative democracy and still represents the &quot;will of the people&quot;
As long as Brexit isn`t cancled the referendum is still respected.
So can we please stop polarizing and work together for a satisfying conclusion?</comment_content_initial>

The problem is as a democracy we didn’t vote for an EU lite, the nation voted to leave.

The other parties would naturally oppose the government, all politicians on both sides are egotistical and power hungry and would do anything to boost their own profiles, isn’t it funny how 3 years ago the majority of parties were for upholding the will of the people?

Party politics has crippled Brexit, we could achieve anything if we just all worked together. 

Should it come about and be the disaster that some people say it would be then you can always vote for a party that campaigns for rejoining the EU no? Isn’t that democracy? 

Whatever happens remain/leave I hope yourself and everyone else continue to speak their mind and have their voices heard peacefully and without conflict.

That to me is true democracy.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>It's worse than that Adam. There's a huge percentage of leave voters who see Boris deal as a sell out. They won't vote for it and boycott any referendum. There's also leave voters (like me) who'll refuse to take part....as unlike remoaners I accept a win/lose poll. If I participate then I'm accepting remain  and after winning a poll I'm not prepared to accept.

Then there's the SNP, they are happy to have a 2nd vote and participate in that vote but unwilling to accept win/lose.

2nd ref is remain by a huge margin and low turnout.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">What a mess the Tories are in and they it&amp;#39;s affected the country alredy with this sick Brexit they brought to the UK. Instead of fixing the internet social, work and health care problems the country in still under since ever. This contributed to leave votes.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;What now??&lt;br /&gt;Well the Government want to make the UK chronic social,work and health care problems much worse with the hard Brexit agenda.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They also want to willingly or not split the union.&lt;br /&gt;They know a hard Brexit could do that but they don&amp;#39;t care.Because they don&amp;#39;t support soft Brexit or people vote for softer Brexit or no Brexit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;They know a softer brecit will be good for people and the economy. Also will save will cost billions much less to the UK instead of a hard Brexit. The money will boost many desperate services in the UK and will create jobs and better health care.Billions and billions a month will cost the UK incase of no deal...and somewhat less then that with May&amp;#39;s deal 4. But still billion of losses in case of a hard Brexit.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;But the Government simply don&amp;#39;t care.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The government was cool to trick the queen handmade her agree to the unlawful suspension of the parliament. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Yet many MPs are supporting the government including some opposition MPs which so strange and makes you think what&amp;#39;s is wrong with them or what s there for them to support Boris for his hard Brexit agenda. Knowing verywell he can&amp;#39;t be trusted. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;France ,Germany, Ireland do have  financial gains in future from the negotiated deal it pass. As the UK over all status including the currency will weaken for unknown future. &lt;br /&gt;So strange to see May talking again and it just look exactly like the old May as PM trying to make her old deal pass.

            <comment_content_initial>What a mess the Tories are in and they it's affected the country alredy with this sick Brexit they brought to the UK. Instead of fixing the internet social, work and health care problems the country in still under since ever. This contributed to leave votes.

What now??
Well the Government want to make the UK chronic social,work and health care problems much worse with the hard Brexit agenda.

They also want to willingly or not split the union.
They know a hard Brexit could do that but they don't care.Because they don't support soft Brexit or people vote for softer Brexit or no Brexit.

They know a softer brecit will be good for people and the economy. Also will save will cost billions much less to the UK instead of a hard Brexit. The money will boost many desperate services in the UK and will create jobs and better health care.Billions and billions a month will cost the UK incase of no deal...and somewhat less then that with May's deal 4. But still billion of losses in case of a hard Brexit.

But the Government simply don't care.

The government was cool to trick the queen handmade her agree to the unlawful suspension of the parliament. 

Yet many MPs are supporting the government including some opposition MPs which so strange and makes you think what's is wrong with them or what s there for them to support Boris for his hard Brexit agenda. Knowing verywell he can't be trusted. 

France ,Germany, Ireland do have  financial gains in future from the negotiated deal it pass. As the UK over all status including the currency will weaken for unknown future. 
So strange to see May talking again and it just look exactly like the old May as PM trying to make her old deal pass. The only defence this time is the position of Tories seats but the language and the deal more or less the same but with worse desperate people .

The opposition still the same trying to get what is right for all the UK not just to please brexiters who didn't change their minds yet.

The failed Brexit so far isn't the fault of anyone. It's beacuse of the democratic process and the UK population should be proud of this. It is sending a strong message to the rest of the world that a government is not higher then the parliament and the law.

The unfair Brexit campaign promising a good soft Brexit Norway style and all the 350 m a week to the NHS  This unfair behaviour was undemocratic .All these has contributed to challenges the government is facing right now. 

The biggest problem right now is the fact that Boris is full of good words to BRAINWASH people in order to get what he want but not what he promised to give and do. History confirm the fact that he can't be trusted. And that is it.

Boris May's deal 4 which he is calling it a new deal.
That deal is a hard deal and could get even harder if it pass. No way to be sure of ANY FREE  TRADE DEAL WITH THE EU.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Drake Hound Every political party and major political figure agreed to abide by the result of the referendum. The government (and/or parliament) may not be legally obligated to fulfil the result of the referendum, but they voted en-masse to have the referendum in the first place, and there will be hell to pay if they revoke Article 50.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It was a referendum - a vote. It wasn&amp;#39;t a survey, or a poll. It was a vote. We voted to leave.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;It doesn&amp;#39;t really matter who&amp;#39;s left in government and who isn&amp;#39;t. The result of the vote stands, and will continue to stand.</original_script>

It was a referendum - a vote. It wasn't a survey, or a poll. It was a vote. We voted to leave.

It doesn't really matter who's left in government and who isn't. The result of the vote stands, and will continue to stand.</comment_content_initial>

This actually makes his deal more likely to pass and takes the no deal scenario out of his hands . On top of that the commons will probably amend it to tie us to a customs union . Did you even watch the analysis on the news and react just by reading the Tory Press . This is not good news if you want a WTO Brexit just wait and see .</original_script>

Saying &amp;#39;People Decided&amp;#39; is not a true statement, and a very weak argument when presented with the facts and numbers of the actual vote. I personally don&amp;#39;t care either way if it&amp;#39;s deal, no deal , stay , don&amp;#39;t stay , I don&amp;#39;t personally care 100 percent genuinely and seriously.

            <comment_content_initial>@C Laws It isn't the agreement of Parliament unless there has been a proper vote on the matter.

When I first heard about these 'votes' that MPs were referring to I scoured Hansards looking to find when Parliament had got together to 'decide' that the referendum should be treated as binding.  Only to find that it *never* happened.  They were talking about individual conference votes and I don't think it's certain that every party had such a vote.

I haven't found a moment in Parliament where every party assembled and agreed to treat the referendum as binding.  I am fairly certain no such record exists.

All that is there is reference to individual party conference votes to 'respect' the outcome of the referendum, which
a) Were made before the Cambridge Analytica/AIQ scandal was exposed,
b) Made before the Tories tried to exclude Parliament from involvement in interpreting the referendum outcome and
c) Made before the pitiful size of the Leave majority was known.

You 'respect' the outcome of an advisory referendum by discussing it, not by treating it as a binding mandate.  You 'respect' the outcome of an illegally interfered with referendum by throwing out the result, prosecuting the culprits and holding another referendum.  And you 'respect' the result of a referendum that proposes constitutional change, which produces a statistically insignificant result in favour of that change, by holding another referendum (or voting on an agreed threshold and applying it).

And millions of us have already lost our trust in the UK's democratic process.  Because we have been excluded on the basis of a knobbled vote in a manufactured referendum *manipulated by a far right cabal embedded within the Conservative party.*  So the damage has already been done.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>@Wendy Follett &quot;I met a girl who sang the blues,
asked her for some happy news.
But she just smiled and turned away
 So I went down to the sacred store, where I'd heard the music, years before, but the man there said the music wouldn't play
And in the streets the children scream Lovers cry and Poets dream.
Yet not a word is spoken The church bells all been broken
And the three men I admire most
The Father Son and Holy Ghost well, they took the last train for the coast
the day
the music
died&quot;


Oh ya and    Right with ya baby! Manipulation is a topic for discussion.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@adscri No amount of reading will in any way justify 80% of MPs making a false manifesto pledge to get elected. I strongly suggest you do some reading on how democracy works, and stop excusing those currently subverting it. I also suggest that you DONT vote ever again, because your moral compass  is as broken as that of the people you are excusing. Very sad.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@glyn hodges i agree with you. If I would ever dream to be a politician on this planet, I would be a UK Tory. They always had a clear sight regarding EU. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Even if one can complain for &amp;quot;changing the rules during the game&amp;quot; , you can not pass the responsability of UK leaders to the EU. Therefore, if it might have been stolen as we discuss, those who had the power to protect were following some other line of interest and they should be the ones answering the questions. There are always ways to bribe or fool the gatekeeper but then he should answer for this acusations. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Also, you can not deny that in nowadays macro economic behaviour, the ideea of solidarity under the EU flag, makes much more sense then divided small countries. A united and monolitic Europe is a better protagonist on a global scale today next to USA, Russia  or China. It is a realistic and worthy vision. I, personaly prefere the alternative of variety and relatively independent states working together. But I can bot blame the EU for aiming at more unity. I hate it, I hate the evergrowing left, I hate the cultural massacre happening, I hate the grey as a standard of living, I think UK does a great job defending it&amp;#39;s culture and values...but I think freedom demands sacrifice. And if yoy guys have the power to break free, you should go all the away, without blaiming EU at all. You guys can be great again but do it as masters of your own path without arguing about EU methods to undermine soverenty - it sounds more as a reaction then a decission.</original_script>

You are getting confused because you don't know what a constituency is.



406 constituencies voted to leave and 242 voted to remain.

            <comment_content_initial>Well, maybe UK will do well after Brexit. 
It will be interesting to watch the consequences.
I agree with you. UK wasted EU time and money....and is damaging European economy.
I wonder if there are already drafts for new rules how to handle exits on future.
And how to section countries who do not share EU burdens fairly.
I hope that there wont be any further EU expansion towards Eastern Europe.
The first enhancement was already a mistake. 
It is too expensive and these extremely corrupt countries do not add value despite of cheap labor at the cost of locals and migration into our welfare system.
If USA wants the EU to accept these countries for geostrategically reasons, they can invite them to join the Nato directly...and pay for them.
Albania and Macedonia?! What a Nightmare!
If a small number of countries (not equaling corporations ...I refer to the tax payers) have to bear all cost and social burdens, EU doesn't make sense.  
We do not want to be the paymasters only. 
We do not pay taxes without getting anything in return. It is not our aim to finance growth in other countries while the money is missing at home.
Obviously, it is the target to decrease our living standard and rise the standard of others to get one level in the EU. I don't think that it will be accepted to Transfer of Money, jobs and Know how to Eastern Europe and still to China, while we are still paying other peoples bills.
Brexit might be just the beginning.
Perhaps it is mandatory to abolish the EU in order to free the way for a new alliance of better selected and better matching partners with the same vision, values, targets and similar economic power.
Since the crisis in Greece, migration crisis, Chinas influences in EU, the rise of Trumpistan, right wingers and Brexit I doubt that the EU can be reformed like necessary.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>I initially thought the same.
But UK proved to be no teamplayer at all.
They are opportunitic profiteers who do not share the EU vision and targets...and do not appreciate the benefits of an alliance.
The bad attitude, hostile behavior, all diese Trump alike lies and ignorance were shocking.
It is all about protecting die Money laundry Business in London City. The EU claims regulation of the criminal finance sector (remember the financial crisis triggered by Lehman and Greece, das Layers hat to Rescue these disgusting banks)
and tax justice. UHNWI and corporations have to Pay their fair share.
No tax pay, no Sales!
London City don't feed UK and the elites give a shit on the interests and needs of the people, as demonstrated.
Finally, EU doesn't agree with privatization if public Assets like die NHS, supports minimum workers rights and Stands for quality control and safety rules.
Yes, the EU is ruthless and evil.. it will be much better to live in US predator capitalism and neo facism.

If people think so...
It might be better to continue without England.
Scotland is welcome.</comment_content_initial>

2. Calls for a referendum were blocked and denied for many years.


3. To stop the rise of UKIP BOTH main parties promised referendums, BOTH were elected to power on those promises, BOTH reneged on the promises when they realised what the result would be. Such is their contempt for democratic process, the electorate and their lack of morals.


4. ONLY when after a quarter of a century, and polls showed a comfortable win for remain, were we finally allowed a say in who rules over us and who we pay taxes to. 


5. Despite massive Government propaganda, which started long before the leave campaign and which both began and ended the &quot;race to the bottom&quot;, the leavers won the referendum. A democratic ballot box vote.


6. AFTER the result the courts concluded that despite what we had been repeatedly told, the referendum was advisory.


7. In the election which followed, those who did not promise to &quot;honour the outcome of the referendum&quot; did VERY badly. Well over 80% of ALL MP's were elected on a manifesto promise to &quot;Honour the outcome of the referendum&quot;.

8. If you do not represent what you claim to represent at election time,and vote against it; then it is NOT representational democracy. Many MP's do not represent their constituents, or the UK, or even their own manifesto.


9. There was a democratic vote to leave.

 These things blocked, sabotaged and undermined a democratic vote to leave.


Not that this came as any surprise to me, for the por-EU groups have been anti-democratic in their actions, and contemptuous of anyone who disagrees with them from signing us in onwards.

The way in which hardworking, successful business's and individuals are 'painted' as the villains. The Labour Party would only make this worse.

               <original_script name="Roman">@OFTP . Consider how the government will have no legal obligation to honour workers rights in Boris&amp;#39;s Brexit deal. This is something that has clearly been grafted onto Brexit. So how could people really know what they were voting for? A final say referendum would be on the actual Brexit. Perfectly democratic.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Wendy Follett Thats a fair enough view. Personally I believe May&amp;#39;s deal would restrict growth and ensure further austerity. I am in my 40&amp;#39;s and can semi retire even with austerity but to achieve that outcome you must retrain and work for yourself in a capitalist world. No workers rights will ensure success just more slaves to the system.  I would also suggest you review Labour impacts on the economy historically as they are far worse for people who want to progress. At the end of the day Working rights haven&amp;#39;t been removed and it would only be possible by the UK government which we elect. The Labour party are acknowledging they can&amp;#39;t win a GE and make it UK law that is the main issue here. If the Tories did reduce working rights which hasn&amp;#39;t been proposed they would drop votes which is exactly what they are trying to avoid. Do you believe working rights should be controlled by UK courts or ECJ?</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Andrew Foster it is correct that the deal Boris has secured has moved the promise to secure workers rights from the legally binding text to the political declaration. Even May&amp;#39;s deal was better for the UK. Thanks to austerity I have to keep working for another 7 years and I am very unhappy that now those 7 years can be hell on earth thanks to the tories! I say no to this deal, I would rather have the May deal.</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Stu Morris so you still won&amp;#39;t answer the question then?😂. Well thanks for proving exactly what I&amp;#39;ve said about you to be true. Full of bravado and replying to me no problem, acting the big man and know-it-all. Yet you lose the ability to read when I ask you a simple straightforward question. Then act dumb and claim you don&amp;#39;t even know what question I&amp;#39;m asking. Then when I&amp;#39;ve spelled it out so that a dumbass can understand, you say you don&amp;#39;t read most of what I say. It&amp;#39;s funny though how everything is responded to APART from my question. Very strange. As I&amp;#39;ve already said, I knew this was the way it was going to go. Every single time this works😂. Someone talks shit, I ask them a simple question regarding their comments. They don&amp;#39;t have an answer because it&amp;#39;s not possible to justify bullshit. They come up with a million and one excuses not to answer the question every time I continue to ask it (making themselves look weak, pathetic and stupid). Would be much easier to just answer the question than think of excuses not to answer it, surely? Why wouldn&amp;#39;t you take the opportunity to show me how I&amp;#39;m wrong? Now there&amp;#39;s an interesting question. But no, of course instead you&amp;#39;ve just used all the classic responses to avoid answering. &amp;quot;I didn&amp;#39;t see your question&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t understand what you&amp;#39;re asking&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;I don&amp;#39;t read everything&amp;quot;. Heard it so many times. &lt;br /&gt;Well, Stu the big man is actually a pussy that hides because he can&amp;#39;t answer a simple question regarding what is going on in his own head. Or should that be, he isn&amp;#39;t man enough to admit he can&amp;#39;t answer it without exposing himself as a  hypocritical shit talker. &lt;br /&gt;Glad we cleared that up and made it obvious to everyone that you&amp;#39;re talking so much shit that even you yourself can&amp;#39;t explain it. Carry on hiding then, we can all see what a weak, pathetic man you really are. Or, just answer the question to instantly prove me wrong. But you won&amp;#39;t of course. You can&amp;#39;t😂</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@Stu Morris I literally broke it down and explained it two days ago, right after you claimed you didn&amp;#39;t know what I was asking (even though I&amp;#39;d already asked you a few times). You&amp;#39;re conveniently never ever seeing the question when I ask it 😂. Must be blind as well as stupid. Look, I&amp;#39;ve established that you&amp;#39;re a dumb hypocrite, because you can&amp;#39;t explain your hypocrisy to me. Pretending that you go temporarily blind every time I ask you the question is a dumb and desperate tactic to avoid admitting you don&amp;#39;t have an answer. Tbh, every comment you make now makes you look more and more stupid. I&amp;#39;d give up now if I was you, and maybe go buy yourself some glasses</original_script>

               <original_script name="Roman">@glyn hodges. I said that there weren&amp;#39;t any food banks back then. At least none I was aware of. And collection baskets were not in every supermarket. The need for both has exploded over the past ten years though.

I can&amp;#39;t see how anyone could possibly argue that the Conservatives are somehow better. At least not for the average person. And don&amp;#39;t mention the economy.

  Good grief.
 And Blairs expansion of higher education to 50% of the population was just stupid.  I have worked in many places and none at all needed 50% of people to have degrees. 
 In the Phillippines a local told me their McDonalds was better than ours.  I asked why so and she replied 'Because you need a degree to work in McDonalds here'.
