            <video_title>EU agrees Brexit extension to 31 January- BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>The EU has agreed to extend Brexit until 31 January 2020, according to a tweet from the European Council president.

Donald Tusk said the bloc would allow for a so-called &quot;flextension&quot; - meaning the UK could leave before the deadline if a deal was approved by Parliament.

It comes as MPs prepare to vote on proposals by Boris Johnson for an early general election on 12 December.

The SNP and Lib Dems have also proposed an election on 9 December.

The draft text of an agreement for the 27 EU ambassadors - seen by the BBC - also included a commitment that the Withdrawal Agreement on the UK's exit from the EU cannot be renegotiated in future.

            <comment_content_initial>私は日本人だけどアメリカよりも中国とイギリスのほうが好きだよ。
First of all, I'm Japanese but I like China and the United Kingdom more than the United States.
China now has a friendly relationship with Japan.China is very friendly to Japan.
So I am worried about the UK.
GDP No.3 Japan has TPP.
GDP No2China has one road.
GDP No4Germany has an EU.
But GDPNo5 UK has nothing.
これが現実だよ。イギリスはもっと現実を見たほうが良い。This is reality. Britain should see more reality.
It doesn't mean anything because there is no reason for military action between the powers.
Just the righteous example of Japanese emperor Majesty Although Britain has sent Prince Charles, I think the UK attaches great importance to the relationship with Japan.
さあ、どうするの？イギリスは。
これでもしスコットランドが独立、北アイルランドが独立となったら。
国力はほぼ無くなる。
What about Britain?
If Scotland is independent and Northern Ireland is independent.The UK ends up with a big drop in power.さようなら。ということになってしまう。</comment_content_initial>
