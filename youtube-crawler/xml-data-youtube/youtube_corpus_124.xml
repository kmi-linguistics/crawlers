The DUP was heavily connected to the Protestant terrorist group the UDA, and was the ONLY group in Northern Ireland to oppose and campaign against the Good Friday Treaty which finally brought peace to NI after 30 years of political and religious violence.

They got 28.1% of the vote vs 27.9% for SF in last election. The margins between supporters of union &amp;amp; nationalism is 1-3% with the rest of the population neutral on staying British or being Irish. The neutrals however side with the nationalists on the issue of brexit heavily &amp;amp; are very pro remain EU. So the DUP are irellavent as a voice on brexit for NI.

               <original_script name="Roman">@jaymcaaa they are actually. They formed a deal with SDLP. So a vote for SDLP will be a vote for FF. If the 2 jurisdictions ever reunite, then those parties will merge. Not really. They are a joke party in the south &amp;amp; always will be. They have thoroughly demonstrated their incompetence in the north. 1000 days with no gov. up there. Also due to the good friday agreement &amp;amp; Irelands genuine commitment to it. No party in majority in NI will ever be allowed to take office in the Republic as it would make it impossible to have am Irish gov. impartial in treatment of NI while SF are in that gov. so unless they get an all out majority, voting SF is always going to be a wasted vote &amp;amp; they are a waste of space. They might as well be abstentionist in the south &amp;amp; shut their holes. I am from the country. Live in the country, vote &amp;amp; follow the politics. SF are not the biggest party, never where the biggest &amp;amp; with their latest polling trends likely to be wiped out in the south at the next election.</original_script>
