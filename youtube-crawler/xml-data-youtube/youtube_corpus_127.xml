            <video_title>Turkey to suspend Syria offensive, Mike Pence announces - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Turkey has agreed to a ceasefire in northern Syria to let Kurdish-led forces withdraw, US Vice-President Mike Pence has announced.

The development followed talks in Ankara between Mr Pence and Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

All military operations will be paused for five days, and the US will help facilitate an &quot;orderly withdrawal&quot; of Kurdish-led troops from what Turkey has termed a &quot;safe zone&quot; on the border.

Turkey launched its assault last week.

Its goal was to push back from its border a Kurdish militia - the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) - that it views as a terrorist organisation.

Turkey had hoped to resettle up to two million Syrian refugees in the area, but critics raised fears that could trigger ethnic cleansing of the local Kurdish population.

INDIAN FEEL PROUD OF BRITISHR. 

IF PAK WILL  NOT INCLUDED IN BLACK LIST, WHAT WILL BE IMPACT ??????????

 *WHY PAKISTAN MUST INCLUDE IN BLACKLIST?*

2. There is no exception for Christine,  recent case of sentenced for eashninda.

3. Afghanistan already registered COMPLAINTS  on world forum for terrorist infiltration in Afghan  from pakistan.

4. There are several attacks by terrorists origin  of those terrorists is pakistan.

5.AMERICA captured Laden from pakistan, Can pakistan deny his protection to LADEN?  

6. America already BLACKLISTED HAFIJ SAYED, &amp; LIST of terrorist institutions in Pakistan, American investigation agencies that confirmed support of pakistan for funding, training by Pakistan Military to terrorist, PM Emaran accepted this before Hon.Trump &amp; before Mr. Putin in Russia. 

7. Bangladesh also supported, Pakistan as terrorist country, &amp; complained for terrorist  activities of Pakistan in Asian countries.

8. China already jailed Muslims in shin-ziyang for their Islamism activities.

9. Chaina expelled out Pakistan's students because of their, Islamic activities in china.

INDIA submitted several countries dossier for terrorist attack on URI, PATHANCOT, PULWAMA ON IDIAN MILITARY. ALL THESE ACTIVITIES ARE OPENLY CONFIRMED BY MUSHRAF, NAWAJ SHERIF TOO.

14.EMARAN PM of pakistan admitted that 30 to 40 terrorist organisations of terrorists are still active in Pakistan. Before the President Trump.

15. INDIA already launched  surgical strikes on Balakot &amp; POK to destroy terrorist training camps. India send the evidences surgical of that to several countries, where as PKISTAN denied the surgical strikes, &amp; otherhand MASOOD AZAR openly took responsibility with video, audio tapes  released by PAKISTAN BASED  terrorist Masood  Azar, like ISIS. 

*CONCLUSION:*
IF PACIFIC ASIAN CONTRIES CAN LIST OUT PAKISTAN IN BLACKLIST, &amp; FATF DOESN'T? THIS WILL SEND VERY BAD MESSAGE BEFORE THE WORLD.

PEACEFULL COUNTRIES OF WOLD  WILL ASK TO FATF, IS THE DECISION OF FATF, IS THIS A JUSTICE  TO PEACE LOVING COUNTRIES?  

THIS WILL BE MOTIVATION TO PEACE LOVING COUNTRIES  TO ADOPT TERRORIST  POLICES, &amp; FOLLOW  PAKISTAN, GIVE ATOMIC  DETOR TO OTHER CONTRIES.

RECENT LIVE EXAMPLES OF KORIA, TURKI, PAKISTAN ARE BEFORE PEACE LOVING COUNTRY. AND WORLD WILL TENDS TO BECOME TERRORIST COUNTRIES LIKE PAKISTAN, TURKY, &amp; KORIYA. AND WORLD-WAR WILL BE SOON.

*HENCE PRESSRE ON FATF IS REQUIRED TO LISTED IN BLACK LIST.* FOR LEARNING TO TURKY, KORIA.

               <original_script name="Roman">Having a common enemy (ISIS) at some point in conflict does not automatically equate to Kurds being our allies. Technically during World War II, the US and Soviet Union were both fighting  nazzi Germany. Did that make us allies? Absolutely not. I’m  tired of hearing idiot libs casually referencing Kurds as allies. The Kurds have a selfish interest of their own which is to create their own country in the Middle East. That is their agenda plain and simple and Turkey is the number one enemy to that plan. This is an ongoing conflict that the US should not take part in.</original_script>

This is a clear attempt to displace ethnic kurds from their homeland so that they will have a harder time gaining a free country in which they could finally live in peace. Erdogan is out of his mind.

*For the backstory of the fighting:*
kurd in turkey have been oppressed a lot by the turkish goverment for a long time. Many kurds have been banned from speaking their language, practicing their culture or wearing their traditional clothes. After the pkk was created due to the oppression, it had claims for a independent kurdistan and was against all the oppression.

Turkey responded by killing and torturing many kurds which led to kurdish nationalism to increase and created the hatred. Kurds then retaliated by then fighting against the turkish government, leading up to the pkk-turkish war. Also turkey now decides to create a 'safe zone' by killing and displacing many kurds from their homeland wether innocent or not. Most of the deaths have been innocent kurdish civilians from the pkk-turkish war, if you look at almost all sources.

*i as a iraqi kurd do not hate turkish people. However their GOVERNMENT has treated us kurds badly, not their government but others too like iraq (saddam hussein). These bad treatments have all been due to a attempt to stop a free kurdish country.*</comment_content_initial>

Only invasion of Afrin alone caused displacement of over 150k Kurds. The only real purpose of Erdogan&amp;#39;s operation is to destroy Rojava. All the rest is just propaganda.

Turkey always helped (and still help) those people without looking their ethnic background. Above 10 million Kurds live peacefully in Turkey. They are Turkish citizens just like other people coming from different ethnicities. Rather than trying to understand the facts, you believe just what you want to believe. Just a fanatics mindset.</original_script>

Oppression of the Kurds was one of the reasons Russia went to war with the ottomans in the 1800s, which arguably started the whole ball rolling on the Balkans 2.0 situation we have now.</original_script>
