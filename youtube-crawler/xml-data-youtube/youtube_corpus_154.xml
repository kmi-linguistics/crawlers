            <video_title>Japan deploys military after deadly typhoon - BBC News</video_title>
            <video_description>Japan has deployed tens of thousands of troops and rescue workers after one of the strongest storms in years hit, killing at least 18 people.

Typhoon Hagibis made landfall south of Tokyo on Saturday, moving north and bringing severe flooding.

Thirteen people are missing from the storm, public broadcaster NHK said.

In central Nagano prefecture, water surrounded Japan's famous bullet trains while helicopters plucked stranded residents from rooftops.

A total of 27,000 military troops and other rescue crews have been deployed in relief operations, authorities said.

Sea Level Engineering

Beloved in Christ Jesus Daniel the prophet who was captured by the Babylonians said that in the last days of this world scientists and geologists will be unable to predict the changes and destructions in the sky and the earth and will tear their clothes and run helter &amp; skelter. Whatever they predict will be incorrect and the end will be desolation and destruction. In today’s world scientists, geologist &amp; astrologers were earlier claiming that the end of the world would require millions of years however, now they also claim that it may be in a few centuries so they advised that mankind should move to another earth like planet. Now they claim that the climate has changed, deforestation has been done to create bigger and new cities, ozone layer has been breached, the industrial waste and plastic generated by man, pollution caused by vehicles, fresh water and sea water have contaminated which has given rise to Global warming. They also claim that due to this the icy poles of the earth are fast melting and the sea level has risen alarmingly which may submerge many island and cities very soon. 

The reasons given by the scientist for global warming are untrue. When I was young I was taught by my teacher Ms.Teresa that the pollution caused by vehicles, industries or fire would rise up and the pollutants in the air would be brought down to the earth by rains and would turn to dust giving rise to fresh air once again. The scientist, engineers and others who in the process of covering their mistakes are prophesying a false news.

            <comment_content_initial>Amy Knorr is the registered direct bloodline descendant of Marilyn Monroe.

Amy Knorr is the real Farrah and the real Madonna. Madonna feigned fat Farrah as if thin. The Farrah-Madonna is the v.2 of Amy Knorr's current lifetime appearance, including the changes through the year 2000 but remaining blonde. Version 2 was set to marry Julian Casablancas, Soulmate.

Polita Barnes, the bloodline descendant of Catherine Howard, aka Peggy Marks, is literally &quot;working&quot; the entire Glendale, CA Police Department, on behalf of the highest tier of the Russian underworld patterned behind the Norwegian underworld.

When the underworld bumped out the real thing of Amy Knorr via sabotage, a cheap imitation was offered. Julian Casablancas did not &quot;get it&quot; because he is an underworld operative and the other underworld operatives are assigned not to tell Julian Casablancas any information. Meanwhile, the public knows...

Six signs that your sexual feigning service is feigning your Soulmate, perceived and pertained to the feigning service itself:

1. Foul odor

2. Failing health, skin.

3. Genital disorders including STD's.

4. Smoke or other signs or visions of punishable sin.

5. Bodily deformation caused by pertaining to a conflicting pattern as if the sacred twin pattern of your one and only Soulmate.

6. Alcoholism.

Polita Barnes enforced unhealthy, poor sexual feigning services amongst operatives in the underworld.

Amy Knorr's v.2 appearance worked out as if the final appearance prior to disability,  caused Soulmate mode in the sexual feigning services of cousin Jen McCarthy Mons with Julian Casablancas.

Juliet Joslin, Jen McCarthy Mons and Polita Barnes worked together for the sexual feigning service saboteur plot against the remaining saboteurs, to effect &quot;total destruction&quot;.

Polita Barnes also feigns v.2 of Amy Knorr's projected appearance.

https://youtu.be/UrZRpXoKoFQ

The saboteurs in general feigned the Soulmate Union Sexual relationship between Amy Knorr and Julian Casablancas with its ideas, as if the sacred ideas were the parlour tricks of a circle of sexual feigning services, orgie style rather than one on one.

https://youtu.be/mQ_k_VG6Syc

Julian Casablancas learned to perceive Amy Knorr in v.2 mature at the perception change feigned by Juliet Joslin, Jen McCarthy Mons and Polita Barnes.

Because the other saboteurs, Lisa Bullock, Gwen Stefani, Rose McGowan,  are assigned to &quot;change things up&quot; based on the real thing of Amy Knorr as is, ideas are lost, and Julian Casablancas cannot perceive how to retrieve anything. Julian Casablancas cannot perceive himself.

Julian Casablancas perceived that he &quot;lost touch&quot; with Amy Knorr during sexual feigning services but it was a &quot;mute point&quot; because he is still able to sexually feign.

The &quot;demolition trio&quot; is necessary in order for Julian Casablancas to sexually feign.</comment_content_initial>

               <original_script name="Roman">@gigi paris  the war between North and South Korea was started by the west after they separated from North Korea. They say the North Koreans dug a hole into Seoul, but its actually the other way around. The west has been known to lie, cheat, and steal all throughout history to gain an advantage. That&amp;#39;s why the citizens of the west don&amp;#39;t even trust their politicians and will continue to get taxed for no reason. That situation in Vietnam was fabricated by the west too when in fact more Vietnamese were murdered by western forces than any other country.</original_script>

Jeremiah 25
You shall not be unpunished, for I will call for a sword on all the inhabitants of the earth, says the Lord of hosts. Therefore prophesy against them all these words, and say to them: ‘The Lord will roar from on high, and utter His voice from His holy habitation; He will roar mightily against His fold.

Ezekiel 13:13
Therefore thus says the Lord God: “I will cause a stormy wind to break forth in My fury; and there shall be a flooding rain in My anger, and great hailstones in fury to consume it.

Now if you didn&amp;#39;t believe that strong delusion has begun, remember when T.I went to prison and got out and started speaking at churches? He recently made a song with Teyana Taylor called Be there. I assure you real, hardened criminals go to prison and hell because they believe in the broad path not the narrow righteous path. The righteous scarcely make it remember? So where and with who you choose to spend your eternity with is totally on you. A political God who can work miracles will be in office presiding over the entire world soon to offer you his name or number of his name in your right hand or forehead. Those who were pure in heart saw that death was better than life with the wickedness of the world. Eccl.4:2-3, Proverbs 31:6-7 Strong drink for your heavy heart.</original_script>

In recent years, Japan has been hit by large Typhoons causing flooding and landslides, but it has been rare that the Kanto area (Area around Tokyo) or further North was affected. In an ironical way, we were lucky to have been hit by a large Typhoon about a month ago, which let people be more prepared this time.

            <comment_content_initial>Pray to the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God DIRECTLY.
When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites;
but GO INTO YOUR ROOM, close the door and pray to your Father who is unseen, and then your Father who sees what is done in secret will reward you.
GOD IS SPIRIT, so his worshipers must worship in the Spirit and in Truth;
they are the kind of worshipers the Father seeks.
&quot;Matthew 5-7 NIV Bible Gateway&quot;, we can use google search.
These are the teachings,
The Righteousness of our Lord Jesus Christ our God.
PRACTICE and TEACH
REPENT, and start doing what is right.
I am the way, the truth, and the life.
No one comes to the Father except through me.
My SALVATION is on the way, my Righteousness never fails.

In the New Heaven and New Earth, only Righteousness dwells.
Psalm 37 NIV
Warning Against Hypocrisy
on Matthew 23 NIV
God's Righteous Judgement
on Romans 2 NIV
The Good Shepherd and His Sheep
on John 10 NIV
Warning to Escape Babylon's Judgement
on Revelation 17-18 NIV

May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with all.</comment_content_initial>

Did you search and read all the chapters I have shared you?
Because if not, I suggest you read it all first for you to be able to understand.

And I am not here to convince you but only to show you the way and it is you who is going to decide if you are going to believe or not.
I am not here either to argue or debate on your knowledge.
This is the way, I showed it to you. I opened the door, and now it depends on you if you are going to enter to this door or not.
God bless you.</comment_content_initial>

            <comment_content_initial>@Helen Pauls But my dear,
GOD HAS NO RELIGION.
I am here to give a warning, and to share the good news from the
Kingdom of Heaven.
The decision to believe is up to you.
Salvation is up to the Lord.

Every man has a freedom to choose which path they are to take, but only to take the full responsibility on their choices.
Once the Lord gave you instructions and you didn't listen;
it is already you, not the Lord.

May the Lord bless you and your family.
May the Spirit of our Lord Jesus Christ our God be with all.</comment_content_initial>
