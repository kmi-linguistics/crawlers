Comment3	Turkey has yet to pay for the Armenian Genocide and illegally annexing Western Armenia.
Comment 3.1	​@Gois Zanner Per the Wilsonian Arbitral Award, Western Armenia is a sovereign state.  Following the main killing phase of the Genocide, millions of hidden/converted Armenians live in Turkish-occupied Western Armenia and millions spread worldwide will be returning their homeland upon liberation.  Turkey will pay.
Comment 3.2	John Carr what do you mean with illegally annaxing western Armenia.
Comment4	Sorry for my ignorance but why is this all happening
Comment 4.1	Because this life sucks. And ppl are so sick of this sick life and they are trying to end this world ASAP. 😕 According to what it seems to me. Nothing makes sense at all. The only thing that makes sense, its the end of this sick world.
Comment5	Erdogan&#39;s political future is dark..He needs money and victories for next elections..His support is below %40 now.. He is planning to build buildings on safe zone, because his supporters are mostly building companies.. Europe will give the money ..He will blackmail europe.. If Europe does not give the money he vill open the borders..This is his plan for healing Turkish economy.. If he can not achieve his plans, he will lost the elections and than go to prison.. He has not got any other option..I think this is good for immigrants and Europe but bad for Kurds.. There are 5 million arabs in Turkey and i do not want them..Kurt&#39;s does not want them in their areas too. What is our fault ?..Why they are in my country? Kurds will ask same question? <br /><br />But some of the building will be build for Kurds too..And there are some petrol on the safe zone. I think Turkey will build two federal areas..Same as Barzani Kurdistan supported by Turkey.. Turkey will make buildings, sell goods and buy petrol.. <br /><br /><br />Problem is not Kurdish/Kurdish problem..Problem is money problem..Not only for Turkey..For USA too..No country in the area is better then Esad..
Comment6	Democrats won&#39;t even allow Trump to secure America&#39;s borders but you want him to bomb another countries borders? Wtf is that? HYPOCRITES!!
Comment7	so sad
Comment8	Washington liquidated its Syrian bases located near key cities: Manbij, Ain al-Arab, Ain-Isa, Et-Tabk, Tel Abyad, Tel Tamr, Tel Beidar, Hasek and others. Initially, US President Donald Trump claimed that with the withdrawal of troops from Syria, American soldiers would be able to return home. However, despite the unwillingness to participate in “endless wars” in Near Washington, the American leader sends his fighters to Iraq, where the operation against the Islamic State group continues (ISIS, Islamic State Islamic State - a terrorist group, banned in the Russian Federation).

Comment12	Tik tak tik tak
Comment13	Why is there a ceasefire? To protect American proxy YPG/PKK terrorists?
Comment14	Cease fire is a US trick to play for time. Turkey better be alert externally and internally.<br />Never trust USA which is an agreement BREAKER.
Comment15	These Kurdish-led forces are listed as a terrorist organization by several states and organizations, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, and the European Union.  So now the Democrats and the US media think Americans should die to protect them?
Comment16	USA trying to get their tool (puppets) YPG terrorists out of harms way.
Comment17	"NATOs King of Norway Anders Behring Breivik Always draws Royal stright flush every morning at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zaiDJqM4SsY&amp;t=07m15s"">07:15</a>. Its gonna be a norweigan civil war over Norway"

This is a compromise trump used to hide his fault of withdrawal of troops from the border and I&#39;m 100% sure it wouldn&#39;t gonna work kurds wouldn&#39;t going anywhere leaving his land to turks
Comment 22.1	Long live the sultan
Comment23	Mike Pence, he of the religious right, seen here, selling his soul to the devil to keep Trump happy, while insuring the death of thousands of Kurdish people, people who  fought side by side with Americans in the fight against terrorism...maybe he needs a little of that &#39;reconditioning&#39; he so appreciates and supports for gay people! Come on, Mike!! Don&#39;t be an anti American hypocrite!! (TOO LATE!)
Comment24	🖕the 💩mike pence.
Comment25	There&#39;s no 2m refugees if there&#39;s no war happened. The Q.Where wars begun and who&#39;s behind the groups?

Comment29	america and ypg surrendered :D
Comment30	We are feeding  4 million Syrians in Turkey long and long time . Enough is enough.   It&#39;s not invasion but a must to send them back safely . Idiot western media especially BBC is nothing but dog
Comment 30.1	Most Westerners think the same thing about the BBC, lol. No one trusts these propagandists anymore, except for old people.
Comment31	The World knows by now That Turkish regime is criminal regime and big Mafia,That regime in Ankara spreads terrorism around the world and Middle East,Trump is ignorant and does not know that much about Middle East and  also doesn listen to military advisors,He wants to give 13,000 square Kilometers of Syrian and Kurdish lands to a big terrorist regime to settle 30 islamic groups and their families,What kind of ceasefire is that ? That is shame on Trump for his weakness and wrong decision,
Comment 31.1	You and your knowledge of the situation sucks balls. Have you even lived in mid-east?
Comment32	"So sorry for American tax payers. their money which used to equipped terror groups like PKK and PYD will be burn into aches. US a created and armed terrorists PKK then now they&#39;re whining about Turkey which determined to destroy this threat!!<br /><br />Isn&#39;t it true that Kurds dreamed to build their own country by taking pieces of land from four countries they are living in? Are they hoping to become 2nd Israel with the support of America!!!"
Comment33	Turkish brutal regime is a big shame in Nato,EU needs its independent force that can stand against Russia and China and USA,Trump will sell you too,Trump is arrogant and selfish and very weak,He sold His Kurdish partners to a brutal Turkish regime,Trump bent down to Erdogan and sold USA army reputation,This so called ceasefire wont work,This is a big rubbery of Kurdish lands by Turkish ISIS regime,
Comment34	That means America is behind this attack, because that&#39;s why Turkey also listens
Comment35	Once oligarch Trump has been dealt with properly, whether the UN send him to a black site or a real American decides enough is enough, most Americans agree the Kurds should take turkey as their own country and send Turkish terrorist leader to the same black site!
Comment36	Europe and America brace yourselves for 3.6 million people.

Afghanistan already registered COMPLAINTS  on world forum for terrorist infiltration in Afghan  from pakistan.<br /><br />4. There are several attacks by terrorists origin  of those terrorists is pakistan.<br /><br />5.AMERICA captured Laden from pakistan, Can pakistan deny his protection to LADEN?  <br /><br />6.

Comment45	Trump could cure cancer and the BBC would complain
Comment46	Pence to Turkey, stop or we&#39;ll crush you!
Comment 46.1	Must not have been a very convincing argument. He was only able to get a 120 hour pause.
Comment 46.2	Actually it was the opposite Ankara gave Washington 120 hours if nothing comes from it Turkey will still continue and hit them harder
Comment47	Trump is a pig shit pig. Blond pig.
Comment48	Usa 👎👎 Turkey 👍👍👍👌👌😂
Comment 48.1	@Char Aznable usa and isreal dog saudi arabia? 😂😂
Comment 48.2	USA  👎👎  Turkey  👎👎 👎  Saudi Arabia 👍👍👍👌👌😂
Comment49	Ergoan obeyed usa order again lol
Comment50	Syria tragedy was forgotten in the world’s agenda. The legitimate-authority gap at the northern Syria threatening Turkish border and 3.6m refugees were not really the world’s number 1 pri-ority. Turkiye succeeded to bring the attention back to Syria tragedy with the wise steps. With the agreed 120-hrs pause of the operation and the others putting in motion the promised ac-tions, the path to the real solution through the legitimate stakeholders in the region is to be opened.
Comment51	Just imagine if it was Iran and not Turkey that illegally invaded Syria. The Zionist states of America would have declared war.
Comment 51.1	@Enes Uzar please. Tell me.
Comment 51.2	What is Turkish govt.&#39;s motive? Honestly, what do you think?
Comment52	So Trump has created a vacuum of world peace on the Turkey border? For about three days.
Comment53	Turks are the ones who have crossed borders, everything else is bullshit..Turks think that NATO will protect them while they&#39;re  constantly shitting on NATO. Seriously do the Turks really think that Greece another NATO member will come to their assistance while they&#39;re constantly shitting on Greece?.Something is seriously wrong with the Turkish mindset, they want everything and give  less than nothing..Crazy?
Comment 53.1	Yes you are crazy
Comment54	US can do anything in the world but when other countries began to do something they forced us to stop.
Comment 54.1	It&#39;s a power-dynamic situation. Just as when Rome or Imperial China ordered &#39;their&#39; Client Nations to stop fighting each other, the same is true of ours.
Comment55	USA is world bully,Now we know who is helping terrorists.and who created daesh
Comment56	The International Tribe are sending them to Germany. Turkey will funnel them through, it&#39;s disgusting what they are doing.
Comment57	Erdogan wins again.👊👏🇹🇷
Comment58	its not kurdish forcess is zionist pigs and zionist puppet USA mercinarys pulling out..
Comment59	Millions of lives? WTF?
Comment60	Love u turkey
Comment61	I love you 🤟 KURDSTAN ♥️ salute for all the brave Kurdish fighters
Comment62	BBC can hide behind all the fake news &amp; distraction stories you like.<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />Shame on BBC for cowardly hiding behind the official secrets act to cover-ups UK establishment child grooming gangs, since Mr&#39;s Windsor took to the throne &lt;&lt;&lt; WESTMONSTER
Comment63	Turkey is squeamish about taking on the Russian bear. <br />Two cowards Trump and Erdogan are bearing witness to one another.
Comment64	why are you taking completely the sermon?  do you know what is goin on north of africa ? do you know whats goin on plastin ?do you know whats goin on egypty? do you whts goin on yemen and muslim rohynga and muslim iigor in the chines ?
Comment65	Like kid fight:)
Comment66	Its not &quot;Kurds&quot;. Its a marxist-leninist terror organization. There are 13 million Kurds living in Turkey and many others all over the World. While this is the case, they are not able to find any volunteer person that accepts to fight for them. They are kidnapping-forcing kids and women to force them to fight. Most of them in Syria came from Iraq after local people forced to migrate, hundreds of thousands local Kurds of Syria migrated to Turkey and rejected to live in the areas controlled by the terror organization. <br /><br />Stop following your state controlled media, they are washing your brain to justify their invasion in ME.
Comment 66.1	@Franz IV Turks listen to Turk news, the west listen to Jewish news
Comment 66.2	"&quot;Stop following your state controlled media, they are washing your brain to justify their invasion in ME.&quot;<br />Amen. Goes for you too of course ;)<br />As all you say 100% turkish state sponsored propaganda."
Comment67	Lol! Just as Pence announced it, the deal was Broken. There are still fighting in Syria.
Comment 67.1	@vikkabikka Russia can have it. Maybe they&#39;ll turn on the Turks in due-time and take back Constantinople, lol.
Comment 67.2	True. Why would he not?<br /> Its Russia interest first. Just like USA are spinning their wheel of Fortune, its just that Putin does not have to Rock the Boat very much. USA is Practivly giving Russia free launch in Middle-East lately..
Comment 67.3	@vikkabikka Vladimir Putin is &#39;always&#39; playing a Chess game in some form or other.
Comment 67.4	Putin has no power in this. He will not engage the Turks with his Airforce, unless Turkey Airforce do something first. It will most likely be a low influx of conflict, in which Russian troops sits back, and they give weapons and ammo to the Kurds. My 2 Cent
Comment 67.5	vikkabikka ...<br />Have no way of knowing. Putin hasn’t weighed in yet... have to wait and see.
Comment68	Mike Pence&#39;s attempt to characterize an abject surrender as a victory is almost as ludicrous as the belligerent letter Trump sent to Erdogan several days ago. The ineptitude of the Trump administration is simply jaw-dropping.
Comment69	Trump has capitulated to Turkey by agreeing to lift sanctions in exchange for a five-day delay in Turkey achieving its objective.
Comment70	nothing to do with pence russia has scared the turkey scum
Comment71	Action ,Drama
Comment72	İf the Usa dont want to people die, ypg have to remove traps and close army tunnels
Comment73	Turkey must never trust the United Snakes.
Comment 73.1	@Pittas Savvas there is nothing related to my history knowledge
Comment 73.2	🇹🇷yes💪
Comment 73.3	Turkey is a big snake in the world. Nobody likes them
Comment 73.4	@Chris P Bacon were you born an idiot?  Or did you become one after   visiting turkey?
Comment 73.5	@Adina Akcolova Go back to school and learn about some real history.
Comment74	America has more nukes in that area than in NATO! <br />American need few days to retrieve those nukes to their own place.<br />Erdogan released those nukes to avoid F-117 jet induced nuke attack on Turkey. 😂😂😂
Comment 74.1	F-117 is not in service. I didn&#39;t bother reading the rest.
Comment75	Syria belongs to syrians. Arabs, Kurds and other ethniticies side by side. Hope the region may find peace soon.
Comment76	Barbara Platt still alive, WHAT?????!!!!!!
Comment77	Yes pls. Let American soldiers escape from there  as their tails are in between legs for quite some time now. 🐕
Comment 77.1	Good then it was a good idea for us to leave, I&#39;m glad u agree. You are a good little lad
Comment 77.2	amerika askerleri girecek delik arıyordu sonu oldu
Comment78	You literally see fireworks going off celebrating the Syrian Arab Army coming back into it&#39;s territory to protect Syrian kurds.
Comment79	Fuck the mongolians durgs
Comment80	I hope YPG and Syrian government reach a Deal and combined forces of Syrian Military, YPG, Govt supported Militia and Russian Special forces move to the Purposed &#39;safezone&#39; by Turkey and push the Turkey out of Syrian border and protect the sovereignty from Evil Turkey and USA...
Comment81	Having a common enemy (ISIS) at some point in conflict does not automatically equate to Kurds being our allies. Technically during World War II, the US and Soviet Union were both fighting  nazzi Germany. Did that make us allies? Absolutely not. I’m  tired of hearing idiot libs casually referencing Kurds as allies. The Kurds have a selfish interest of their own which is to create their own country in the Middle East. That is their agenda plain and simple and Turkey is the number one enemy to that plan. This is an ongoing conflict that the US should not take part in.
Comment 81.1	"We are not enemy of that something is very clear.We recognized syria in the 1920s and also we recognized Iraq in <a href=""http://1920s.so/"">1920s.So</a> that our neighbours are syria and IRAQ.If some terror organizations who are a threat of Turkey,SYRIA or iraq they have rights to start OPERATIONS to these TERROR ORGANIZATIONS which is OFFİCIALLY called &quot;Terror organizations list&quot;for EU and USA.Turkey is not interested to have land in syria or something stupid.Turkey is doing what EU or USA must do in that territory.Also when this OPERATİON started GERMANY was warning TURKEY but then they started to say that lets make safe zone and EU must be in that zone.The main question  is what Turkey said when they started this OPERATİON?They said same thing but I Think some countries doesnt want to listen their ALLIES..."
Comment 81.2	Platinum121212  you claimed US and soviet were not allies during WWII, when both were fighting the nazis. Which is completely false. They were allies, US even gave aid to the Soviets via lend lease. The Kurds actively aided the US it the fight with isis, and was even called an ally by trump himself. I guess trump is just one of those libs just making it up. lol
Comment 81.3	Darryl Hearn they were called the allied powers for the sake of cooperation against nazzi Germany. Then we had the Cold War. Calling the US and soviet union allies is very silly as ideologically they were much different and had their own selfish interests. Cooperation was necessary against nazzi Germany though much like the cooperation of Kurds against ISIS.
Comment 81.4	Platinum121212  US and soviets were allies during WWII. Basic history. lol
Comment 81.5	pkk is trying to do this by suicide attacks and shelling civilians since 80s and 90s, while trying to hide their racism behind marxist-leninist ideology. US are using them as puppets.
Comment82	Great job Trump.<br />He is very sensible , fair and bravr in this decision.<br />Creating a safe Zone in Syria for Syrian to return home  is very  noble . Why are all the objection and stupidity to oppose it ?<br />Syrian inckude Arabs, kurds etc so whats the issue ?<br />The Kurds  have no right to steal the Syrian land for themselves.
Comment83	Search Culiacan sinaloa

Same is Trump.<br />If Trump was smart enough (which he&#39;s not) he goes for China right now with full force. Looks like Trump is losing big and China now in a Driver seat. <br />Our true enemy and biggest terrorist is China,  and not Talibans or Turkey etc...<br />China stole our ip, technology, money, jobs etc... China is now taking over the globe and will not surprise me if in next dacade we lose Hawaii. <br />Stop our true enemy, no compromise, and full 100% Tarrif from day one. <br />Trump needs to get some true intelligent people and not all these jokers and hokers around him.<br />China wants Trump lose 2020 and at this point it will happen unless Trump wake up and stop all nonsense and finish China communism criminals or it will be too late. Good luck
Comment 103.1	That will fuck our economy
Comment104	Turkey was and still is the only race, I call it a tribe, that the world could do without. They have accomplished nothing in the long history of the world, nothing to show for except .........furniture, I guess. Since these mongols appeared on the map and in the “world stage”  they have stolen, killed, lied, tortured, started war and conflicts, just death and despair. There are certain races that the world could do without and that’s certainly one of them.
Comment 104.1	As a ordinary turkish citizen, trying to do best in my life your words makes me sad for a 1 minute. Sorry but your words totally garbage. You better learn something about Turks if you going to say something this big

Comment108	Mean while the Onion just reported Trump was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for bringing peace to the middle east.  To bad the only party to agree on the cease fire was Pence, neither Turkey nor the Kurds agree to the terms Pence presented at his press conference.  You think the media would have learned this administration lies alot.

Comment115	Uh ya, no. There is high Dudgeon going on here. Knowing criminal Trump as well as we do in US, some kind of dirty deal is going on. Anyway, it remains to be seen if offensive attacks actually stop after Second Turd in Commnd licks Erdogan&#39;s boots. We&#39;ve seen Turkish security and bodyguards kick the stuffing out of protesters in last US visit. Highly doubtful they&#39;ve changed their opinion on Amercans and American Policy.

Comment128	...
Comment 128.1	Are you sure ?
Comment129	What kinda &#39;safe zone&#39; is this. This is a clear attempt to displace ethnic kurds from their homeland so that they will have a harder time gaining a free country in which they could finally live in peace. Erdogan is out of his mind. Why not send the refugees to their own homelands instead of kurdish homelands by displacing and murdering them. Problem fixed<br /><br /><b>For the backstory of the fighting:</b><br />kurd in turkey have been oppressed a lot by the turkish goverment for a long time. Many kurds have been banned from speaking their language, practicing their culture or wearing their traditional clothes. After the pkk was created due to the oppression, it had claims for a independent kurdistan and was against all the oppression.<br /><br />Turkey responded by killing and torturing many kurds which led to kurdish nationalism to increase and created the hatred. Kurds then retaliated by then fighting against the turkish government, leading up to the pkk-turkish war. Also turkey now decides to create a &#39;safe zone&#39; by killing and displacing many kurds from their homeland wether innocent or not. Most of the deaths have been innocent kurdish civilians from the pkk-turkish war, if you look at almost all sources.<br /><br /><b>i as a iraqi kurd do not hate turkish people. However their GOVERNMENT has treated us kurds badly, not their government but others too like iraq (saddam hussein). These bad treatments have all been due to a attempt to stop a free kurdish country.</b>
Comment 129.1	<del>Chairs</del> I am not saying the pkk forced them to leave their home. However the area was formerly arab, so what is more natural than kicking invading pkk(which came from ıraq) from north syrian lands and resettling the original citizens there? Population were mostly arab and turkmen in north syria except kobane
Comment 129.2	@-Chairs- you want a Kurdistan in someone else&#39;s nation, dont start a war because you want a new nation then cry about it when you lose.<br />  Your so called Kurdistan will only benefit Israel. <br />Why didn&#39;t Britain and France make you a Kurdistan after ww1? Because to use you dumb mountain people for divide and conquer so the Muslims can&#39;t unite.
Comment 129.3	@Mustafa  Çimrin pkk has not displaced arabs from anywhere
Comment 129.4	@Mustafa  Çimrin idk if that is true, but i do believe isis displaced about 3 million +
Comment 129.5	I think you have some missing information about the population. Only 350.000 of kurds were displaced from that area because of the war, while more than 3 million arab and turkmen were forced to be refugees. If you google you can easily find it online
Comment130	Not the kurds is a damn ypg pkk terrorist stop using the word kurds the terrorist ypg need gtfo from syria not the kurds
Comment131	<b>Thanks Mr President Trump.</b> 🇬🇧🇺🇲👌🏼
Comment132	I am turkish. and I can say that we are not fighting kurds, we already have kurds in turkey more than 20 millions. we are fighting against kurdish terrorists. they are different things. 2nd, usa want the build kurdistan like how you found israel before. 3rd we have 3.6 million refugees, we want to send them back to their country, so we want to make safe zone for them. or if you want we can send them to you. choose one of them.. you are terrible news medias... it is better to quit nato. nato is arming terrorists against own their allies like Turkey. we are right we will win. usa is just believe in money... we don’t.. do your best, we don’t afraid your sanctions...

Comment 132.3	Turkey until recently didnt even let Kurds ro speak and learn their mother tongue. The majority of the turkish population support such fascist policies.
Comment 132.4	@Tarık Mengüç Lol! Take care of your sick man first.
Comment 132.5	so,all that boils down to the land. Turks are fighting for the land they hit in potluck, isn&#39;t it? It was never the Kurds and the people. It was always the land. And you know what? That&#39;s call selfishness and you should be thought a lesson.
Comment133	👹+👹+👹=☠
Comment134	The Kurdish militia fighting ISIS. That same ISIS that Turkey let into the area by tearing up several km of border fence around 2014. Turkey is guilty of supporting terrorism.
Comment 134.1	Pue propaganda... (1)There was no wall/fence whatsoever before 2016. (2) Turkey asked European counterparts for intelligence about their citizens. Europeans refused to give. No country on the earth can take into custody a foreigner without evidence. Once Turks found evidence they expelled them. Still today Europeans do not want their citizens back. (3) Turkeys infrastructure is used to fight ISIS... Just listen Mr. Stoltenberg, general secretary of NATO.

Comment139	This is bullsh****. The Kurds have been left out in this negotiation. Kurds homeland is invaded by Turkey. Then Kurds are expected to leave their home on Turkey’s terms? This is bullsh***. The US has sold the Kurds out to Jihadi ISIS  Turkish Erdoganist scum.
Comment140	From Isreal! Did anybody get the Plot? Trump feeling the heat in America. Told his buddy , that Turkey Erdogan, to start bombing Syrian people. Then be a HERO by announcing he has broker the peace deal Ceasefire. I have to ask! What Ceasefire? You can&#39;t have a Ceasefire between two Rivals when one has all the Tanks, Missile launcher and WMD -  against Women and Children?
Comment 140.1	@Mindy McNamara Baron Munchausen movie. Little girl yells : Stop it, Stop it.&quot; That was you. Mindy.
Comment 140.2	You mean Israel against women and children or I miss understand?
Comment 140.3	nikorn chinakul , not to mention that it’s isn’t the big ceasefire / peace deal that trump is ( once again) exaggerating about. It’s simply a 120;hours ‘ pause’ so that we can get our troops out. It has NOTHINGto do with anything or anyone else. He is such a lying bulls****er
Comment 140.4	sounds like israel plastine conflict
Comment141	Correction. <br />There is no US.<br />Its Zious.
Comment142	BBC, where is the Catalonia news???<br />Can we see your report about Catalonia?

Comment 142.4	Go to DynamicNews or DWN. You will see true news
Comment 142.5	@Chris P Bacon Then why have we all heard about them via the news networks?
Comment143	TRUMP wins again.
Comment 143.1	Wins biggest dipshit to sabotage the office of the president of the United States.
Comment 143.2	more like turkey wins again this is a small delay in their victory.
Comment 143.3	Wins the prize for the greater larger great bigger better best biggest cock up in that region...
Comment144	So this is Trump&#39;s new success strategy now? First cut with a knife and then apply a bandaid and expect to get praise for how good of a doctor you are.
Comment 144.1	The left have shown their true colours this week, all my life they have been shouting about how America should stop policing the world, Foreign Wars etc etc, Trump in 2016 said i want to eliminate ISIS then i want to pull out of the middle east. The left need to wake up and realise they are being taken over or led by the Globalists who are there enemy? It&#39;s the Globalists who are advocating Socialism so they can stop free markets and control everything.
Comment 144.2	you blame blame blame but we need FREE KURDISTAN
Comment 144.3	hobo dog bingo, if ur anti war the trolls get upset
Comment 144.4	Back to the children&#39;s table with you, the adults are speaking.
Comment145	Moron ... now it was all a plan. Uh-huh ...
Comment 145.1	Guess so
Comment146	BBC is crap!!
Comment147	It&#39;s not a ceasefire, it&#39;s a complete capitulation before Erdogan. Why the hell would the Kurds have to move out from their own territory? So that Erdogan can bring more real islamist terrorists and criminals? The orange clown puppet totally lost his mind.
Comment 147.1	@Arif T Not true. Nothern Syria, especially the Afrin province occupied by Turkish islamists since last year, were predominantly Kurdish. Only invasion of Afrin alone caused displacement of over 150k Kurds. The only real purpose of Erdogan&#39;s operation is to destroy Rojava. All the rest is just propaganda. Arabs  want Erdogan out of Syria as much as the Kurds.
Comment 147.2	That part of Syria was mainly arabs. Those arabs were pushed out from their homes and are refugees in Turkey. Turkey is giving back what belongs to syrian arabs
Comment148	What a joke! It’s like if I would come to your house and hit you badly and kill your wife+children and after kick you out from your home. In the end I’ll make pace with you and tell everybody what a great man I’m . Whit all respect, US sold out their great regional friend “the Kurds” and making fun of them in the same time.
Comment 148.1	They deserved every bit of it, and Syria is not their house, especially not when they want to divide it
Comment149	Now that Trump&#39;s failed with turkey taking over the war I wonder if it&#39;s going to be Iran or North Korea again we&#39;ll see here real shortly they&#39;re failing to start a war any place they can and they&#39;re failing to get somebody else to do it so they can make money off selling weapons to them
Comment150	A cease fire to give the Kurds a chance to leave they&#39;re land?......<br />Of course Erdogan says yes.<br />Thies KURDS are dangerous!<br />I&#39;m affraid they&#39;re not going anywhere.
Comment 150.1	civilian kurds can live in safe zone.
Comment 150.2	If they don&#39;t retreat hopefully Erdogan will burn them alive
Comment151	Question here: What do you want to hear? Ypg saying No? <br />You are not interested not  Native locals &quot;Kurds, Arabs, Yezidis, Armenians, Turkmens&quot; turning back to their homes who lived there for hundreds of years?<br />Sound like you don&#39;t like that!<br />Also you have made a mistake which actually is the truth you should not say: Those Ypg Militants have not only been fighting ISIS, their major interest is to have an autonomous area for theirselves! But to the world thay have been served as Ally to all who fought against ISIS!<br />Very well done! Keep up the miserably misleading journalism up!
Comment 151.1	Then Let me ask  people who defends for kurdistan:California has lots of germans since USA found,Why dont they build their own country?They deserve(🤦🏻‍♂️🤪) for their own land?Or why dont irish poeple built their own country?They deserve to have country?Or catalonia,Turks in russia,native americans in USA?Also as a KURD who lives in Turkey,I am proud to be Turk.This is very simple.Turkey has over 15 million kurds and they dont use us as a dog or something(Thats the tactic of USA or EU).Also Kürdistan is not a even Kurdish!It is persian and guess who gave officially this name in this territory ?It is OTTOMANS OR LETS SAY TURKS.They OFFİCIALLY told every country that this territory called Kurdistan.They are the first state that who recognized us as a KURD.And if EU and US are so respectful to us why do they started to talk about kurdistan for last 5 years?Dont say they tried to make us legal in history.When syria or regime turned into a garbage you guys started to search for new doggy right?Please stop talking about kurds.I know my own history and to be honest I dont want to be a dog of EU,USA or TERROR ORGANIZATIONS!
Comment 151.2	@Plo Koon well it wasn&#39;t Kurdistan was it you dick....it was Ottoman Land who&#39;s armies duly conquered. The Kurds have different factions and supress and kill each other and will never be as one hence Kurds will never conquer land without other countries objecting it not in this life time....period! C*
Comment 151.3	@T MAN1965 you go study history and learn that was never such a thing as a Syrian or an Iraqi until the british and the french invented it.
Comment 151.4	@Jan Harvey  you really have a screw loose I think your reply comments are funny beyond disbelief!
Comment 151.5	@Jan Harvey shut up you idiot...it&#39;s Syrian land there&#39;s no place called Kurdistan and never has been I think you need to study history instead of telling others to do so....

Comment 158.2	Mick G. , Believe me , we are deeply ashamed at trumps inept and stupid decisions in general but none more so than this one. He is NOT who we aspire to be as a country. I don’t like that we are in wars in other countries but to desert and betray our allies like he has ?!?!  That makes me sick to my stomach and angry beyond words. He is the shame of The USA

Comment172	This existence nothing but a joke.
Comment173	Assad and Putin salute you!
Comment 173.1	Ugh! Those strongmen are simply thanking the mad fireball for allowing them to take strategic locations in killing the Kurds, taking over the US military base (especially the Russkies), firing on approaching enemies in the airspace &amp; bombing oil tanks in the Middle East (possibly through terrorist networks).
Comment 173.2	It&#39;s almost as if Trump is following some sort of rule book when it comes to foreign policiy. That books is written in cyrillic. Maybe Trump made the deal of his life when he very successfully prevented that pee pee video from never getting released to the public. What a great man. A great man.
Comment174	we got it what we wanted to do good done trump u were afraid that turkey is going to make new friends(russia)en trump dont forget that look the map where turkey is ok???but we will never forget that u supported pkk en hey people hier in youtube we have got  20 million kurds we dont have problem with them they are us we are them one body one flag <br /><br />our words one die thousand rises we are not arabs........understand?<br /><br />i love to die for my country as a all turks...

Comment 174.3	@-Chairs- you are right but dont forget it russia is already in hot water(mediterrean sea)<br />1)did u find nucleer bomb in iraq it was reasons right<br />2)why u stole country from Indiana<br />3)why u kill so much black people<br />4)why u are in Afghanistan<br />5)why u used atombomb for japan<br />u can war with normaally right<br />6)and Vietnam<br />7)u know what usa is gendarme for Europa cause European people is much richer than usa people take look ur street
Comment 174.4	@we are turks that is why nato was created in the first place. As a &#39;defensive&#39; alliance to repel the russian threat.
Comment 174.5	@we are turks turkey became apart of nato as a way of eliminating the russian threat in europe, well basicalky in ghe world. They are in a stategic location
Comment175	It will be good UK should try to distance themself from US as it seems US does not have the Midas touch but a Medusa stare. Everything turns to Stone and crumbles. 😭
Comment 175.1	@Rob Ashton I am not really interested usually in things like this but the HK issues really shows the true colors of US politics. Seems to just look one side, close one eye and hope for the best for themselves just to gain some points. Dangerous time for everyone to be in. Crazy Politicians
Comment 175.2	From what I&#39;ve seen, it&#39;s generally something rather less pleasant than stone that everything turns to following the cack-handed ministrations of the United States.<br />Very unpleasant on a hot day.
Comment176	This smells coordinated bullshit
Comment177	The offensive shouldn&#39;t of been allowed to happen in the first place. Many ISIS fighters have already escaped and innocent civilians have been killed.
Comment 177.1	And what would have happened if US Troops had been sent in there? Many isis fighters may or may not have been able to escape during the ensuing battles that would have grown to cover multiple regions and countries and many more citizens of many more regions and countries would have died over the span of months or even years the war would have gone on. Then you would have had not only Trump to rag on right now but also all those heartless American Troops who just stormed right on in there and blasted all those poor people straight to hell.
Comment178	The arsonist burns down the house. Now, he wants credit for putting out the fire. As it still smolders.
Comment 178.1	Alex Smith Kurds are being slaughtered. We are bombing our own airbases in order to keep them for falling to the Russians. A true humanitarian. And brilliant too.
Comment 178.2	Trump is so bad he caused the 100 year conflict between the Turks and Kurds. Got it.
Comment179	Victory belong to Turkey 💪💪💪
Comment 179.1	@Arda Gezik As long as they are happy to live under the Syrian flag and to abide by Syrian law and not want to steal Syrian land. Sure!!

Comment 180.5	Ikr imagine wanting to stop a pointless war
Comment181	Safe zone is needed for the refugees to settle. 5th comment
Comment 181.1	@Pistolet Prezesa your words really Bullshit, I&#39;m not turk nor kurd. I&#39;m living in Turkey and I definitely know and even can prove you that Turkey holds 3 million refugees and I was shocked when I noticed that Syrian refugees given more rights than Turkish citizens, which country can do this kind of stuff to refugees
Comment 181.2	@Pistolet Prezesa Absolutely not true. The people living on both sides of the border are relatives. Turkey always helped (and still help) those people without looking their ethnic background. Above 10 million Kurds live peacefully in Turkey. They are Turkish citizens just like other people coming from different ethnicities. Rather than trying to understand the facts, you believe just what you want to believe. Just a fanatics mindset.
Comment 181.3	@-Chairs- yup, the Syrian refugess must be settled to places they really belong to...not in the autonomous region ruled by Kurds....something really fishy out there!!!!
Comment 181.4	"@Dogan Bahceci <br />Syrian people from different ideolojy and view lives in turkey for 8 year they can live in their own country as well , US and UN can monitör the situation in the safe zone <br />Also Safe zone in Jarablus  working very good  <a href=""https://youtu.be/4pHWjRcNe2I"">https://youtu.be/4pHWjRcNe2I</a>"
Comment 181.5	@Arda Gezik Bullshit. Turkish govt and police didn&#39;t issue any help. They closed the border and basically watched ISIS slaughtering innocent people. 300k refugees got through only because they didn&#39;t manage to stop all of them with water and fire.
Comment182	Hmm. But the democrats supported the terrorist movement in HK with a new bill? Are the complicating what is good and what is bad? It seems bomb making materials was found with rioters of HK and that was somehow good to support them.hmmm

Comment 183.1	T S When the S S Trump goes down, the captain of the ship will push women and children out of the way in order to be the first to the lifeboats. Even if those women and children are his own.
Comment 183.2	T S He only loves himself. Full Stop
Comment 183.3	@Thomas Faggioni Yes he also loves you 😘
Comment 183.4	Trump said;” I love uneducated people”. It’s easy to see why. Ignorance is bliss. Stupidity even better.
Comment184	BBC is weeping - less slaughter means less news.
Comment 184.1	@r385671 Trump was told by Turkey that they were moving in to Syria. What the hell was he supposed to do, send more Troops and start a war with Turkey? I still remember when Trump was criticized for refusing to strike Iran. It&#39;s literally Trump derangement syndrome.
Comment 184.2	The fuck are you talking about? This is all theatrics by Pence and Erdogan. The US left the Kurds for dead, and now they negotiate a &#39;ceasefire&#39; so they can leave? Where are they going to go? That is their homeland. All bullshit. Trump started a major disaster and they think this is an accomplishment.
Comment185	America must stop interfering in the Middle East, and do not pretend to want peace, get out of there and forever, no one wants them, and they have no right to be somewhere 7,000 miles away.
Comment 185.1	Then stay the hell out of non-muslim lands &amp; give all territory taken back to the original inhabitants you disgusting cult of invaders, rapists, paedophiles &amp; mass murderers!
Comment 185.2	@Avi Chetri im referring to the YPG and the PKK.
Comment 185.3	@أحمد جلال Sykes-Picot and western colonialism were before the discovery of oil but yes I agree, Sykes-Picot and carving borders and grouping different people together without acknowledging their religion, sects and tribal affiliation is the basis of disaster
Comment 185.4	@أحمد جلال never said I was smart,just sick of hearing Muslims and all there pity problems,you muslims have been fighting even before oil was discovered,lame response.
Comment 185.5	@stell bass I&#39;m not an American LOL and Kurds deserve their own country
Comment186	Wtf dose this matter
Comment 186.1	@will charlton kurds ? Non muslim minorities ? Lol... I suggest you tou check out election results in turkey.Most of the kurds in turkey supports erdogan and his islamic party.Kurds are mostly and i mean real mostly freakin sunnis wtf are you talking about
Comment 186.2	The conflict between muslims and non-muslim minorities (like the Kurds) is a significant reason why the middle-east is such a powder-keg. Oppression of the Kurds was one of the reasons Russia went to war with the ottomans in the 1800s, which arguably started the whole ball rolling on the Balkans 2.0 situation we have now.
Comment187	Too late. Isis are out of the prisons.
Comment 187.1	Get out of here with that nonsense, Isis was created by Assad.
Comment 187.2	@My 2nd amendment is a right not a need dude isis is Cia, stop the nonsense
Comment 187.3	Wesley - We castrated Isis prisoners to calm them down and make them less aggressive. If they escaped, they are now harmless.

Comment 192.1	@wesley rodgers some cells emptied by YPG thats why Mr. President was giving anti kurd speeches to media few days ago.
Comment193	Life is important
Comment 193.1	@Muhammet Kırıcı<br />Nothing about you or any other subanimal is of kinship to me or any other member of the human species..
Comment 193.2	@Muhammet Kırıcı<br />This may not get to you as the cowards of YouTube and some channels block and delete much of the truth I submit. But I&#39;ll give it a try.<br />When a little girl in the cult if the divine pedophile is between 5 and 8 years of age and without provocation on her part begins to attract the unwanted, unnatural and unsolicited sexual attention of adult cult members (pedophiles) &quot;she&quot; the unoffending child is subjected to a horrific and barbaric procedure. (With her mother and other female family members participation and her fathers knowledge and full approval)<br />the little girl is either held or tied down. Her genitals are split open with a knife or perhaps a razor blade. In some cases even a shard of broken glass is used. The skin is peeled back and the flesh is cut, gouged and scooped away. Right down to her pelvis bone. Then the skin is pulled back together and sewn up with needle and thread. An opening is left just large enough for the child to urinate through and her legs tied or taped together to prevent her wounds from opening till she can heal. All this as the defenseless little girl screams in agony. Is she doesn&#39;t die from infection when the innocent child is between 9 and 12 years of age she&#39;s forced into marriage to a pedophile. Often the pedophile is old enough to be the little girls father and many times even old enough to be her grandfather. The pedophile cuts the childs genitals back open and rapes her. By the law of the cults divine pedophile and ordained by the god the pedophile is free to rape the child victim anyway it wishes. Front, back, top or bottom. The initial act of forcible rape is so violent the tiny, virgin girl often dies as the result of the vicious assault. If the child do survive the brutal attack and again doesn&#39;t die from infection a great deal of time is required for her wounds to heal as she&#39;s being steadily raped by the pedophile. When the little girls wounds finally do heal she&#39;s left with massive scar tissue. This coupled with the fact that she has only skin where there should be flesh makes (sex/rape) extremely painful for her. For the rest of her life...<br />(FEMALE GENITAL MUTILATION)
Comment 193.3	@Muhammet Kırıcı<br />Nope. But it came to your mind.
