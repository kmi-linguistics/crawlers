Comment1	I am From India 🇮🇳 But I love Egypt 🇪🇬❤💙💚
Comment2	The gradually sinking world economy produces hardships which are turned into protests with rioting and destruction. The Hong Kong protests have created recession, now manifest. The protests themselves create the worsening financial situation that caused them in the first place. This disaster is self-perpetuating.  The appearance of WRATH Revelation 11: 18 and financial meltdown Psalms 46: 4-6 is a hand- in- hand disaster now manifest. In Q4 of 2019; 24 violent protests and riots on a large scale have been published. <br />The &#39;kings of north near and far&#39;, Syria and Russia, strut their stuff in the build up to world wide wrath. Jeremiah 25: 24-26 Revelation 11: 18. WE stand at the beginning of an extinction level event, seen in protests and riots in 24 places in Q4 of 2019. Daniel 2: 31-46. &#39;They will not be sticking together&#39;.... the [clay-like] ordinary people; and the &#39;iron-like&#39; totalitarian political forces [The police and military] so that violent protests and riots appear. The 24 places of violent protests in the face of a sinking world economy are:<br />Spain, Sudan, Russia, Egypt, Uganda, Indonesia, Ukraine, Peru, Hong  Kong, Zimbabwe, Colombia, France, Turkey, Venezuela, The Netherlands, Ethiopia, Brazil, Malawi, Algeria, Iraq, Haiti, Ecuador, Lebanon, and Chile.<br />We are at the beginning of an extinction event based on WRATH. Revelation 11: 18: &quot;The nations became wrathful, and your [God&#39;s] own wrath came, and the time came....to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.&quot;<br />&quot;And they try to heal the breakdown of my people lightly, saying: &quot;There is peace! There is peace!&quot; when there is no peace.&quot;Jeremiah 6: 14.<br />The enriched uranium nuclear assets of Iran will be BOMBED, and the pilots will refuel in Saudi Arabia. The anger and reprisal of Iran is seen in Daniel 11: 44, 45. This is the BOMBING of Israel; the &#39;desolations&#39; Matthew 24: 15 that introduce the &#39;Great tribulation&#39; Matthew 24: 21, 22. At this time, Israel is declaring: &quot;Peace and security!&quot; due to the implementation of initiatives orchestrated by the White House administration. 1Thessalonians 5: 2, 3. This &#39;sudden destruction&#39;, spreading into a worldwide cataclysm, is the visible &#39;False prophecy&#39; of  &quot;Peace and security!&quot;  by the False prophet indicated in Revelation 19: 20. The disaster appearing is SATAN; Gog of Magog; Revelation 20: 1-10 coming upon &#39;the soil of Israel&#39;. Ezekiel 38: 18, 19. So the time has come for Jehovah to SPEAK. Jehovah changes the worldwide government, when the political system is ejected from authority at a time of &#39;hissing missiles&#39; 2Peter 3: 10; and Christ Jesus arrives &#39;in power and great glory&#39;. Matthew 24: 21, 22, 29, 30. This arrival is also indicated in Matthew 25: 31, and in verse 34 the &#39;sheep-like&#39; true Christians John 3: 16 are already inside God&#39;s Kingdom at the time of His arrival. THAT is why they are also described as survivors Revelation 7: 9, 14-17. This  Kingdom also outlined in Daniel 2: 44; the Paradise Christ described in Luke 23: 43 will be created from the earth after the five month crisis of the Great tribulation is over. This cataclysm is brought to an end by Divine interventions when the wicked are destroyed Psalms 92: 7 Psalms 37: 8-10. This history has been written as prophecy, so that we can have confidence in the true God, and understand what He is doing to save us from the cataclysm of the Great tribulation. This good news has been preached worldwide Romans 10: 13-15 Matthew 24: 14 to greatly increase the numbers being saved due to understanding and faith. The political system, engages in wickedness so that it resembles a &#39;wild beast&#39; Revelation 13: 11-13. Prophecy shows the political system are all executed Revelation 19: 11, 19-21 and Christ  Jesus Revelation 11: 15, 18 and His heavenly brothers Revelation 5: 10 Rule over faithful mankind in place of them. The time comes for the dead to be raised up in an orderly manner; Revelation 20: 13 Acts 24: 15 because Christ Jesus has died in their places. Romans 5: 12; Romans 6: 23. The end result is a &#39;New Heavens&#39; Ruling over a &quot;New Earth&#39;; a Paradise Revelation 21: 1. Luke 23: 43. This massive change in the structure of human society is on our doorstep. &quot;The nations became wrathful and your [God&#39;s] own wrath came, and the time came....to bring to ruin those ruining the earth.&quot; Revelation 11: 18.<br />We stand at the beginning of an extinction level event based on WRATH; and the true God has promised to act.
Comment3	Who is behind ali
Comment4	Terrible actor.

Comment9	Another fake actwhore.
Comment10	Another fake actwhore.
Comment11	Another fake actwhore.
Comment12	BBC/Sky : &quot;Go Hong Kong!&quot; &quot;Go Venezuela!&quot;<br />Stays silent on the Paris riots.
Comment 12.1	This is fake shit.
Comment13	BBC/Sky : &quot;Go Hong Kong!&quot; &quot;Go Venezuela!&quot;<br />Stays silent on the Paris riots.
Comment 13.1	Previous month I was able to withdraw my first five figure wage ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this company on-line for 2 years now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the best thing about that is the fact I am not really that tech-savvy, they just asked for basic idea of internet and general typing skill...Superb thing about this work is the more free time I got with my family. I am in a position to spend quality time with my relatives and buddies and take care of my babies and also going on vacation along with them very routinely. Don&#39;t avoid this chance and make sure to act fast. Check it out, what it is about... <b>explore486­.­c­o­m</b>
Comment14	BBC/Sky : &quot;Go Hong Kong!&quot; &quot;Go Venezuela!&quot;<br />Stays silent on the Paris riots.
Comment15	Another fake actwhore.
Comment16	Old footage, BBC stirring trouble as usual.
Comment17	bbc how much you pay him for acting?
Comment 17.1	Totally fake actwhore.
Comment18	Muslim brotherhood sponsored protests , smells like Qatari funded
Comment19	The reason these protests and civil unrests are happening is because God is moving and delivering truth and justice and he has the full authority and power to have people commit civil unrest and have the people go against the nations leaders or leader.
Comment20	Any chance of uploading videos about anti tv license protestors? Bbcnews?
Comment 20.1	@cary bary No i don&#39;t but they did not put the date of the footage so i wanted to clarify it.
Comment 20.2	Sinai dude you work for the bbc?
Comment 20.3	These footage is old and there is no kind of protest going on right now
Comment21	al Sisi is definitely not the most democratic governor in the world, but yet, he is the best of all that Egypt had in the last decades. Alternative to him would be the islamo-fasist fraction of &quot;Islamic Brotherhood&quot; Turkey&#39;s Erdogan wants to impose on Egypt and elsewhere in the Middle East.
Comment 21.1	@lyxnafis <br />I&#39;m afraid your information is totally inaccurate! <br />As for Muslim Brotherhood they&#39;re in power in Tunisia and they&#39;re the majority in Parliament in Morrocco and were in Jordan for a long time and the whole world are dealing with them in those countries.<br />In Egypt they were in Parliament in Mubarak regime, and they weren&#39;t terrorists! <br />But maybe because you get your knowledge from documentaries and ignore news agencies you didn&#39;t knw that terrorism in Egypt didn&#39;t stop when Muslim Brotherhood won the only democratic election, so if they&#39;re the source of ISIS and other groups why would they practice terrorism against their regime?!! <br />But as you said you know what your media want you to now, so you&#39;re unable to get the truth unless form documentaries.  You might like to check the Israeli press recent scandal that Israeli government funded and aided the islamist rebels in Syria!  And they treated their casualties in Israel! <br />And you never heard that the war on Iraq was because a lie of weapons of mass destruction and the west brought terrorism to the region. <br />and it&#39;s too funny to talk about Sharia law and islamist regime where in all muslim countries just two of them apply Sharia law Saudi is one of them.<br />If you care that much about what is good for you you may convice your government if you can that they mind their own business and leave the other nations live as they like. That would be the shortest way to peace for everyone one. Not to support a fu*king killer as Trump calls him just because he&#39;s serving your interest.
Comment 21.2	"@Vagabondo I have no idea about his Intelligence Quantity but he seems to be holding and progressing Egypt and, given the circumstances and the fact he is a military person, with a fair amount of democracy. <br /><br />As for the muslim brotherhood, I just know what the whole world knows. I know that they are Islamo-fascists affiliated with ISIS or other terrorist muslim groups. I know that they tried to impose a theocratic regime and turn a secular country into a country governed by sharia. I know that they set up various groups like &quot;Giza&quot; as their military wing that carried various terrorist operations in places like Sinai, Libya and elsewhere including attacks against other religions like the Coptic church erc. <br /><br />Don&#39;t get me wrong, an Islamist regime, sharia and all those things might be fine with you but they are not for me and, I believe, for the western state of being. As I said, everything is not for everybody. <br /><br />There are numerous documentaries for the Islamic Brotherhood i.e.         <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG3fLt4heM"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kyG3fLt4heM</a>"
Comment 21.3	And where do you get your information from to call him democratic and best of all presidents Egypt had?!!<br />That&#39;s too funny of you! Because according to the Egyptians themselves he&#39;s the worst and most stupid person, not even president, to be in government. That guy can&#39;t even say a meaningful sentence! And what do you know about Muslim brotherhood? ! Tell us what they did in their only one year in power! Maybe you know what no one else knows!
Comment 21.4	"@lyxnafis I think I know a good alternative,Left-Wing political <a href=""http://group.trust/"">group.Trust</a> me except some Pro-Russian and Pro-Syrian Tankies most Left Wing political group Arab socialist and MLs hates islamist more then anybody."
Comment 21.5	@Tom Branch It has been proven that often times a dictator establishment should be preferable to devastation of the Iraqi or the Libyan type let alone the Syrian type where the country is ravaged but the dictator gets to remain in power. <br /><br />I don&#39;t think all political systems are fit for everybody... even in our &quot;western&quot; type of thinking not everything is fit for everyone... I wouldn&#39;t, for example, ever accept a God ordained monarchy like the British...
Comment22	THESE UPRISINGS AND DISSATISFACTION OF THE STATUS  ,ARE SURELY CAUSED BY PARTIES BACKED BY US-UK   GOVERNMENTS ,HARIRI OF LEBONON , IN IRAQ THE AMERICAN REPLACED GOVERNMENT ,IN EGYPT .... U NAME IT ?<br />WHY DID U MESS?
Comment23	He&#39;s paid loser
Comment24	Government corruption is happening all over the world. Britain using public money to pay off interest to the private owned banks, borrowed by the corporations. Capitilism is the world&#39;s biggest crime against humanity. MPs, ex ministers hiding public money in buisnesses set up. Local councils hiding public money in buisnesses owned by councillors, changing buisness names before being caught out. Most people are too stupid to understand or just can&#39;t believe this happens.
Comment25	FREE ASSANGE
Comment26	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qPETFKD-Mlo&amp;t=0m03s"">0:03</a> why are there Devil horns on a human?"
Comment 26.1	????
Comment 26.2	Wtf.. ive saw it
Comment27	Egypt was a nicer place when Mubarak was in power. I wouldnt go back there even if you paid me.
Comment 27.1	Well, I&#39;m sorry to disappoint you but no, it wasn&#39;t
Comment 27.2	@Yousuf Tarek <br />Sharia fucked up law is alive and well. <br />As I wasnt a married woman when I checked into my hotel in cairo I was asked to produce a marriage certificate before I could stay at the hotel with my boyfriend.  That is sharia law dickhead.  Fuck your sharia law and big time FUCK islam big time.
Comment 27.3	@Vicki Diana Coghlan <br />You&#39;re just hallucinating!  There is no sharia law in Egypt not now and never before. And maybe you&#39;re high on something because at Mubarak&#39; time Islamists were free and in Parliament but now all of them are in prison or out of the country.  So if Islamists were your problem they&#39;re not there now. And they&#39;ll pay you to visit Egypt just to have the honor 😆
Comment 27.4	@Vicki Diana Coghlan what shaaria law? Have you seen Egypt today
Comment28	Easy for this guy to call for protests whilst sitting in luxury in SPAIN!!!
Comment 28.1	Like the &#39;Officially Recognised Syrian Opposition&#39; who were........not in Syria.
Comment 28.2	Everyone has a brain why would they listen to him if he wasn&#39;t right?!
Comment 28.3	he has a head also and he either needs to go outside. even if i takes a long time. Once in a while he has to face the real world and i guess based on his behaviours that &quot;the outside world&quot; has been seeking for his death since he started the videos compilation.
Comment29	Be careful
Comment30	Hello good luck and god bless 🦖
Comment31	We are witnessing a low-life, pathetic, crackhead, heroin junkie who scarcely had any education, but he has the cheeks to reprimand us about politics, economy, philosophy, social affair, strategy, and there are more to come; as long as his helpless followers and sponsors  are so delighted for his foul language, obscene wordings, repulsive remarks, and vulgar nonsense.<br />Due to his low level of schooling, the duped guy nonetheless thinks he could arrange a ”revolution party” using two packets of cigarettes, a few lines of cocaine, and some hostile network...........a nut case....no doubt.
Comment32	Preparations are underway for the burial of the BBC network.....<br />A small ceremony will take place later at the funeral; the deceased has died during fabricating, falsifying, manufacturing, and inventing news; to incite violence, stir hatred, and cause chaos and commotion all over the region......<br />Any person falls for this kind of stupidity and believes in this hogwash is undoubtedly in a deep trance.....<br />Only terrorists, anarchists, extremists, murderers, stupors, radicals, opportunists, distorted human rights boutiques, low-lifer journalist, and above all heroin junkies would applaud these sort of agendas<br />Getting rid of the Moslem Brotherhood cult forever has been the best thing of all time happened to Egypt........ Thank God for that......<br /><br />​<br />​
Comment 32.1	Tell us Mr Genius what did the moslim brotherhood did in their only one year in power!<br />Did they kill more people than Sisi?<br />Did they imprison and torture more people than Sisi?<br />Did they change the constitution to stay in power forever like Sisi?<br />Did they fabricate the presidential and parliamentary elections like Sisi? <br />Did they imprisoned all candidates for presidential elections like Sisi? <br />Did they double the countrys debts three folds like Sisi and waste them in palaces and fool things while 60% of the Egyptians are under the poverty line.<br />Did they sell two islands to the Saudi despite the rulings of all degrees that they&#39;re Egyptian land?<br />His master, Trump called him a fu*king killer and his favorite dictator!
Comment 32.2	Tom Branch    As long as their ideology is still of a bygone age, and as long as they believe their dated tenet, is infallible; this Islamic cult can rant for hours on end, on Al Jazzerah &amp; CO.; they are divisive, corrosive........ they burned churches, blown up tourists and killed thousands of Egyptians; but they have the guts to rant about democracy, freedom, unity, peace, power-sharing, humanity ......... Whom do they think, they are fooling? <br />This repugnant, Qatari funded streaming Channel is the biggest platform and sponsor for stupors, anarchists, extremists, radicals, opportunists, terrorists, distorted human rights boutiques, lowlife journalists and even heroin junkies.<br />This Islamic cult had dragged the whole region into chaos, havoc, turmoil, violence, and agitation....... In fact, this cult is stagnating any hope of advancement towards democracy, economic developments, and social progress.........<br />Getting rid of this cult has been the best thing ever happened to Egypt........ Thank God for that......
Comment 32.3	What replaced the brotherhood is just as bad, just as oppressive and just as despotic.
Comment33	Let me just clarify some things, Al Sisi the current president overthrew the elected president with a coup d&#39;eait backed with the army killing many inocent protesters in the process.<br />The county has seen no improvement at all during his reign inflation has only increased, many multi million projects have been state funded for the President himself and his family. Furthermore the army had taken a very dictator like rule over the economy with  new projects only funded for army personell and affiliates leaving the Egyptian people poorer and with bigger completion.<br /><br />So yes they&#39;re may not be hard evidence such as paper work showing corruption but it doesn&#39;t require a genius to connect the dots.
Comment 33.1	Lies
Comment 33.2	a lot of points mentioned are either false or exaggerated and shallow opinions. Me myself I am both against political islamisim and the involvement of the military in the civil life, so I am pretty unbiased and I could tell you it would be foolish not to give credits to the sectors that actually did improve under the president&#39;s rule
Comment34	BBC is brave,  Awesome channel.
Comment35	Is this another &quot;deniable asset&quot; of US and the brits like HK? Man f u..
Comment36	Why are they protesting
Comment 36.1	I myself don&#39;t know why.
Comment 36.2	old footage
Comment 36.3	@Good Joke A lot of sectors improved there is no doubt
Comment 36.4	@Good Joke no one is, the numbers are super small and are no where near effective.

Comment48	So tru
Comment49	Ugliest accent of arabic I ever heard:)
Comment 49.1	Wow! That means you&#39;re an expert at Arabic language and it&#39;s numerous dialects and accents! I don&#39;t think so! <br />At your best you might know very little of one of those accents but you think of yourself as a polyglot! 😆
Comment 49.2	What ?!
Comment50	I think BBC news is behind this turmoil in Egypt
Comment 50.1	*uk
Comment 50.2	I think you are behind the turmoil in Egypt.
Comment 50.3	You&#39;re so naive! Why you think so?!
Comment 50.4	There&#39;s nothing happening in Egypt and these protests are old footage also this guy is a paid clown that no one give him a shit
Comment 50.5	@Nevan Masterson Not the BBC. The beeb is simply a mouthpice for the establishment. Not my words but that of journalists who know it well. But of coarse it suits foreign powers if they want regime change in Egypt. As it as always done. The 1953 coup in Iran is now admitted to have been carried out with large help from the CIA. Gaddafi in Libya was overthrown because he wanted to drop the US petrodollar to trade oil in the Gold Dinar. It&#39;s not a theory. It&#39;s true. Only if people are complete morons who do not research outside the MSM that they don&#39;t see or believe it. Big shock. The banking corporate establishment that owns 80 percent of the world&#39;s wealth also influences governments and intelligence agencies. They all do it. Not just the US but Russia and China too. Don&#39;t preach to me either. I am a veteran. I&#39;ve been to Iraq. It&#39;s all about blood oil and murder in the Middle East. And whether a government is on board or not with the globalists.
Comment51	Has he presented any evidence or is he just gobbing off and looking for his 15 minutes?
Comment 51.1	He&#39;s a fake actor.
Comment 51.2	@bittercottoncandy <br />He doesn&#39;t live in Egypt because he has no choice.  Anyone writes a word against Sissi on social media gets arrested for years without persecution.  Anyone wants to oppose Sissi has to get out of Egypt. And that person is so special because he revealed secrets from inside the army institutions where he used to take contracts and talked to the simple people about their miserable conditions while Sisi is wasting billions of international loans in bullshit and asks the Egyptians to starve in order to build the economy!  He even asked the people to donate 1 Egyptian pound everyday while his wife is wasting millions on palaces renovations! <br />While all the opposition figures use special terms to talk about democracy and human rights and freedom of speech ...etc this guy talked to the simple people about their sufferings.<br />And he said he&#39;s ready to be persecuted for corruption if justice is guaranteed but in Egypt the judicial system is corrupted.
Comment 51.3	@bittercottoncandy He does not give a shit about the people here. The side BBC does not show you is that he worked with them for 15 years, yet only left when he wasn&#39;t paid. It is a matter of money for him not dignity or anything. Making the real revolutionaries the people who made the 25th of January Revolution against him (Wael Ghonim, Wael Abbas, etc)  So expect him to exaggerate a lot of bs.
Comment 51.4	@Nevan Masterson no evidence at all, and the numbers are pretty exaggerated
Comment52	Brave man!
Comment 52.1	No he is liar
Comment 52.2	@amro hjajra there is nothing wrong with dreaming.
Comment 52.3	@Blanca J. Christ I hope that his stupidity save us all
Comment 52.4	@amro hjajra bc he&#39;ll be kill if he ever went back to Egypt. The easiest way to die is for someone to mess with a dictator!
Comment 52.5	@Blanca J. Christ why?
Comment53	Oh man!  You put yourself in danger
