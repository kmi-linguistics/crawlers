Comment1	Fuck you trump
Comment2	It’s true. Trump is the only US president who would say something this honest. <br />It’s time America stops intervening. It’s time for the nations of the Middle East to handle things on their own. It’s better for the world. Unless ofcourse you narrow minded idiots in the comments section want another refugee crisis.
Comment3	&quot;You gotta let them fight it out&quot; America pre-Pearl Harbor 1941 (colorized)
Comment4	This man is a human trash. The worst of the worst
Comment5	This is not a joke
Comment6	He Saw too much Godzilla
Comment7	Im kurdish
Comment8	The great america and israel....
Comment9	‘I saved you!’ Trump tells the same Kurds he left at Turkish forces’ mercy a fortnight ago, <br /><br />the Kurds are Very lucky they been saved by the Russian Turkish summit in Russia n this Because the two presidents have respect n trust for each other, these two leaders behave how two friends would behave and they will always find a compromise to suite them  both n the region may their friendship n co operation grow
Comment10	MY people are dead because of this monster i am happy most of the comments are about his disgusting  speach
Comment11	VOTE THE US OUT OF NATO.
Comment12	Those people in the background scare me the most. Frightening stuff.
Comment13	Hoping one wud finish the other then they finsh the other off/ old saying 2 birds wit one stone...
Comment14	Harsh but true. Media does not what us to go in war until Trump decides not to go in war.
Comment15	Trump is insane in the brain.
Comment16	What fuck you say, the Turkish is murder and use any weapons for kill Kurdish people in Syria , your let him to do. A red cow
Comment17	No Americans died, seems like the perfect solution to me, better than Hillary would have handled lol
Comment18	What a childish thought
Comment19	The average IQ in this crowd is hmmm lemme think.... Oh .. 3
Comment20	What do you expect? Kurds have no land that Trump can exploit. He has to protect his investment in Turkey (Trump Tower Istanbul) and he has to make Putin happy (the Moscow Project).  Foreign policy is based on what benefits Trump and his family. Shameful
Comment21	Put yourself in the USA&#39;s shoes. Do we go to war with a NATO ally (lousy as they are) to defend the Kurds? Maybe we should kick Turkey out of NATO. We&#39;ve already sanctioned Turkey which in itself is something I believe no NATO nation has ever done to another member. If you host a party and two of your friends get drunk and start fighting each other do you solve the problem by killing everyone in the room? Everyone has criticism but no one has suggestions. <br /><br /><br />If anything this shows how f&#39;ked up the middle east is.
Comment22	You need to let them fight.....<br /><br />Kinda like Trump and any female....
Comment23	Why do 3RD WORLD PEASANTS , feel their IGNORANT uneducated biased opinions are important , because ANTI AMERICAN foreigners DON&#39;T count ..<br />Period..<br />Fight your own fight parasites.
Comment24	Trump is retarded
Comment25	Hey YouTube.... don&#39;t demand respect ...earn it first ....<br /><br />The community can&#39;t set rules for comments if they&#39;re nothing but abusive ....<br /><br />In Estonia and Finland... people think they are so perfect and above all criticism....and the fact is they&#39;re just as shitty racist and awful as elsewhere......<br /><br /><br />Trump .. tonight I&#39;m all about war...<br />Trump tomorrow.... I&#39;m all for peace.......weirder than Weirdogan...war of the Weirdos....
Comment26	Say what you want, he is right. And not afraid to say so.
Comment27	Trump spent billions on upgrading US military, yet they aren&#39;t able to defend themselves from potatoes hurled by Kurds.
Comment28	pos, ppl literally dying; this isnt a fight at the back of a school

Comment42	many lefty idiots here!! why will you want wars`!?
Comment 42.1	Shut up boomer
Comment43	Why so many zoombies behind and backing his trolling? They were paid or brain dead!?
Comment 43.1	There are more zombies in this comment section. Almost no one here can seem to think for themselves. They think they understand foreign policy, and they pretend they would do the right thing, but where were these people complaining as Obama ramped up the Iraq war? Nowhere. If you THINK you&#39;re &#39;morally superior&#39;, it&#39;s a good sign you&#39;re not.
Comment44	Şunu biri tercüme etsin la.
Comment45	&quot;It&#39;s not our fight, we shouldn&#39;t get involved!&quot; If Russia were to ask for help you can bet your remaining brain cells Trumpty Dumpty would be over there in a heartbeat just salivating at the thought of serving vlad.

What a shame!!!<br />No doubt he wouldn&#39;t do anything about guns... &quot;sometimes you havé to let them shoot at each other...&quot;<br />Yes, america  has a problem! ...and they dare say &quot; ...so help me God&quot; !<br />How pathetic!!!
Comment54	And this dude is going to be reelected in 2020, just watch it happen...
Comment 54.1	Then say goodbye to your allies. Fight your own wars and leave our countries. I vote nato without the US.
Comment55	Despite his unconventional approach, Trump has been proved to have been right on most aspects of domestic and international policy. He is indeed saving millions of lives...
Comment56	Such a liar.
Comment57	"Our special forces worked with the Kurds and know them better than any of us could. When they were ordered out by Trump, I know they felt the pain of betraying their friends.<br /><br />When you travel and meet people as I have, you get to know them as people, not headlines in the paper. No one had a stronger connection to the Kurds than our Special forces working  to rid Syria and the world of ISIS.<br /><br />And they did! Latest news is that Turkish forces are now FREEING the ISIS prisoners that were being held by the Kurds --until Trump allowed Turkey to attack them. That is NUTS!<br /><br />SAD day for these brave heroes, having to abandon their friends to a vicious enemy bent on Genocide of our Kurd allies.<br /><br />Please share if you care about real American values..."
Comment58	&quot;It&#39;s like two kids. Ya gotta let them fight.&quot; This is the smallest scandal he could make while getting impeached. Tune in tomorrow for another episode of Don the Con in Fifty Shades Of Orange. Where he compares the ISIS members escaping prisons, with Where&#39;s Waldo books. &quot;Sometimes you gotta look for em.&quot;
Comment59	Why can’t China or somebody help...innocent bloodshed for what is crazy
Comment 59.1	China is counting money laughing. While oppressing Hong Kongese they have no time or interest in wars in the Middle east.
Comment60	ژنا کەردوغان
Comment61	Zhna erdogan
Comment62	&quot;Without spilling one drop of American drop&quot;???<br />How about Turkish or Kurdish blood?<br />You still think American blood is better or different from other bloods?<br />Dear Trump!<br />Your presence was quite neccessary for the whole world to be reminded of good old days of oneness and unification.<br /><br />Please wake up before you go!
Comment63	Bush starts war in Iraq: He’s joined a pointless war and wasted American lives<br />Trump refuses to join a war: what a monster how dare he not sacrifice his own soldiers lives
Comment64	🤬🤬🤬🤬🤬
Comment65	What is this monster saying “Oh, let them fight” What are these creatures on about? So you just sit there and say this?
Comment66	Just say it Trump — I screwed everything we’ve fought for and made one of my many rash decisions while ignoring my own people and doing anything Putin and friends ask.  people are being killed thanks to my decision, including our allies who saved American’s lives.  Now, I just want someone else to fix the problem so I can take credit for it. AND, back home, I’m busy making sure my family is making all the money from every government agency possible.  I’m hosting the G7 and other Americans and small businesses can kiss my ass.  That’s the way I do business.  This country belongs to me and ME ALONE.  I am the savior of unmatched wisdom.  NO OTHER US business even got to BID on having the G7.  I got it because I’m better than anyone else.  Remember my example,  I can shoot anyone I want to on 5th Ave in New York and they can’t do one thing about it.  <br /><br />You’re right Mr. President.  That is YOU.  It’s finally becoming so blatantly obvious that even members of your own party are having a hard time lying their way to safety.  Thank you for your honest answer Mein Dictator.
Comment67	omg.... he betrayed the Kurds....... what a shame
Comment68	We have reached new level of stupid with this one

Comment71	If @youtube had the ability to post with sound effects, I’d post shitting sound effects for this piece of 💩
Comment72	Lets keep this straight with facts. <br />* the founder of modern Turkey &#39;Ata Turk&#39; will be turning in his grave now watching the direction that Turkey is heading under Erdogan. <br />* Turkey has jailed more Journalist in the WORLD than Iran and China combined.  (there goes the freedom of expression).<br />*  NATO with Turkey in that now is a big Question Mark. Time NATO evolved.<br />* I hope the World has the guts to recognize the Armenian Genocide when it is a known fact that Ottoman Turks massacred more than 1.5 million Armenians&#39;<br />* If Trump does not understand these basic facts, I am switching my allegiance with Trump. Period.
Comment73	I just clicked on this video to read the hilarious comments.<br /><br />Don&#39;t look at me like that! I know you people did too!
Comment74	All children and people die bc of you. I hope God take a reveng from you  . You make my country like this. USA destroy  middle east and kurdistan for thire benefits. You make ISIS

Comment79	And yet he wants to fight Iran
Comment80	trump ,he self behaving like a child ,  shame on usa to have such an useless president
Comment81	They cry when America gets involved in conflict and cry when they refuse to.<br />Lmao.
Comment 81.1	Because many of the conflicts were caused by the US, all of this whole shit wouldn&#39;t have happened if the US didn&#39;t fund terrorist groups to fight agaisn&#39;t &quot;muh commies&quot;.
Comment 81.2	Exactly, the Kurds don’t deserve anything
Comment82	As a kid in America I hope we will one day change our politics to actually act like a politician
Comment83	Because of your stupidity... ISIS will rise again..dont regret stingy idiot.

Comment100	Retarded Drumf The Kurds Will never forgive you for backstabbing them. You gave The Kurds 5 days to leave their home and land to The turks.  You sold The Kurds to The fascist turks. US cant be trusted anymore
Comment101	You&#39;ve all agreed on cease fire? So  they&#39;ve been fighting all these years because you&#39;ve not yet agreed to the law of cease fire? What if you stop producing and selling fire arms to them? What do you think is going to happen?
Comment102	look at these stupid people behind him they clap for each of his single words
Comment103	Free Hong Kong <br />Trump : sometimes you have to let them fight 🇨🇳🇭🇰
Comment 103.1	A good example of why people need to suffer is America and Europe. Both places are utter shit (culture-wise) compared to what they once were. We&#39;re not more moral. Leftist politics is inherently evil to a free and prosperous people. No one suffers enough to remember why we needed freedom in the first place, so every election we give more of it to government. If you think the government is the answer to ANY problem, you&#39;re already wrong.
Comment 103.2	Yes. Sometimes you do. You can&#39;t hand people things and expect them to appreciate it OR hold it. It&#39;s why suffering is valuable. It helps mold people into functional beings. If you think you can remove suffering and have everything work out, it would explain why your comment is about as retarded as most of the other people who commented on this video with the typical mainstream liberal opinion.
Comment104	What you call kid is Turkish Armed Forces you idiot. It is 2200 years old, much bigger and honourable than your dirty history. Be careful when you talk about Turks.
Comment105	Surely Trump the evangelist is a step too far for modern politics.
Comment106	Mess up
Comment107	3 gram aklıya şu salak bile bizim salAK ları kandırdı dalgasını geçiyor :)
Comment108	am afraid its a little bit more complicated then that .
Comment109	"This past week, an employee of a Serbian arms manufacturer was arrested and thrown in jail  after blowing the whistle on a covert US DoD and Serbian contractor trafficking weapons to ISIS in Yemen - a story exposed by Bulgarian investigative journalist Dilyana Gaytandzhieva.

Comment110	Polish American Legions  are for president Trump from day one  and before.
Comment111	let em fight their own battles.  brilliant and original.  love seeing draft dodging liberals go hawkish just to dissagree with trump.
Comment 111.1	@Joseph Kinser Every one of those claims is a fiction. <br />Europe is refusing to renege on the JCPOA and is also continuing to buy gas from Russia. Europe is continuing to trade with China free of any new tariffs. China has signed a long term deal with Brazil for a secure supply of tariff free soya products, and is buying every ounce of pork product that Europe can supply. <br />Last years soya crop in Europe failed totally, and Europe is the second largest user of soya in the world. Under normal conditions that would have led to a rise in soya prices due to demand outstripping supply, but since the USA is currently flooded with soya that they can&#39;t sell even a drunkard like Juncker was able to push Trump in to selling it at reduced price.<br />Even where American made products are on the shelves in shops consumers are buying other stuff, leaving the American stuff on the shelf if there is an alternative available. Government deals can only make a market available, but it is the people who choose whether or not to buy the goods, and the people of the world are starting to see the USA as a tainted product.<br />US agricultural products are seen as substandard and possibly toxic, and airline passengers around the world are becoming nervous of flying in boing aircraft. They even trust the Chinese air safety regulators over the FAA. <br />Donald Trump can brag to the US press all he likes, but the markets are producing figures that don&#39;t lie. Look up how many millions of dollars the US is printing in the current round of &quot;Quantitative Easing&quot; which is a euphemism for currency manipulation and inflation. QE  is only used to prop up a <b>failing</b> economy. The rest of the world allowed itself to be suckered into recession exported by the USA back in 2008, but is now taking steps to ride out the one that is coming soon. Lots of countries are dumping US bonds and buying gold, kissing goodbye to the almighty dollar as reserve currency.
Comment 111.2	@Nehemiah Scudder      can&#39;t believe you said that .  do you want to talk about new export markets?  how about how about that new contract with western europe and asia for record amounts of NEAT oil.  piped straight from the permian basin oilfield directly to the shipping tankers.  bypassing the refineries.  how about record amounts of LNG contracts to the same markets.  a twenty year contract with korea for LNG .  or lets talk about china buying more u.s. agriculture products then we can produce.    export markets we have.  america first.
Comment 111.3	@Joseph Kinser America <b>alone</b><br />Good luck finding allies or export markets for your products.
Comment 111.4	@Nehemiah Scudder         WE DON&#39;T NEED EM.  WE GOT THE TRUMPSTER.  AMERICA FIRST.
Comment 111.5	@Joseph Kinser Yeah and f*ck our Kurdish allies right? You know Erdogan is going to dump nearly 3.5 million Syrian refugees into his &#39;safe zone&#39; so they can get massacred? Just out of interest, somewhat unrelated, what are your views on Socialism?
Comment112	&quot;Let them fight&quot; = innocent deaths.. this is not a game and it is not a schoolyard.
Comment113	We will play these clips for our kids in history class and say &quot;never again. Just as I saw clips from Germany in 1933 and was told the same thing.
Comment114	We&#39;re out of Syria, if Britain wants to take our place, go for it. We have our border with Mexico that we need to defend, and we don&#39;t need to be defending Syria&#39;s border with Turkey.
Comment 114.1	Are you also going to withdraw from Saudi Arabia? How about staying out of Iran and Venezuela as well while you are at it, and stop funding Israel.
Comment115	Humanity is left no where in the world. Shameful
Comment 115.1	Uttrakhandi Boy <br />I do not think humanity deserve humanity.😊😊😊
Comment116	You&#39;re the biggest scam fear-mongering pile of garbage I&#39;ve ever seen in my life!. You hold zero allegiance to America!.

Comment138	Quote: &quot;it&#39;s not fun having bullets going all over the place&quot; excuse me what!? How would you know, have you been to any war, wasn&#39;t it you who bailed out of Vietnam draft?
Comment 138.1	And now watch Putin a real leader how to handle business. Wait till Tuesday. The US (united Stupidest) are out let the Russian bear handle that, sit down, shut up and watch!
Comment 138.2	@handsoffmygun MF stop twisting the words! Syria is also an illegal war because with us presence international law was broken, besides the Russian, no foreign army is supposed to be there. And just that you know there was a draft for the Vietnam war and trump valid out! Call it whatever you want. Play blind man if you want but stop offending my intelligence.
Comment 138.3	Oxz Oz - Vietnam was an illegal conflict. It wasn&#39;t technically a war, because congress never voted and declared war. The warmongers in government called it a police action to violate our constitution that says only congress can vote and declare war.
Comment139	Till this week I was with you Mr.  Trump but you surely lost it! You sound like a stupid idiot. Shame on you. F.....g traitor!

Comment 140.1	The Kurds don’t deserve protection after stealing all the credit from Iraqis.
Comment 140.2	Won’t happen, I don’t think people throw their lives away just like that. The Jewish have brainwashed you.
Comment141	Trump will do anything to keep his base. Fact is there was plenty of fighting before he decided to sell out the Kurdish allies. And he has done nothing diplomatically with regard to the &quot;Pause&quot;. If he did it, why is Erdogan on his way to see Putin on the 22nd? Why isn&#39;t he coming here instead? So, Russia gains more leverage in both Syria and Turkey. Gosh we are having so much &quot;Winning&quot;! Yeah, right.
Comment142	"Look at those red hat idiots behind, that applaud this monster !! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23TRE45ONOUS"">#TRE45ONOUS</a> !!!!"

Comment149	My foreign policy: <br />You say you have an internal conflict that we could go die in on your behalf?<br />Sounds like a personal problem. <br />Sorry bye.
Comment 149.1	An internal problem that was caused by the US.
Comment150	so they purposely put any people of color behind him so they can get the &quot;diversity&quot; shot huh?
Comment151	f this dude
Comment152	This &quot;deal&quot; should show some of his devotees that this is like the deal that is his life, a big sociopathic sham.
Comment153	Turkey is rightful side on this situation.
Comment 153.1	Hahhahahahhahag
Comment154	With Trump as president, no one will even dream of being allies with the US. Trump is a disgrace to his country
Comment 154.1	Nationalist countries love TRUMP. Its the communists that cant stand him
Comment155	And a “fight between kids”. Like how Trump behaves every day.
Comment 155.1	Trump is a complete idiot, now the whole world knows..... but we have been saying it all along!!
Comment 155.2	Orange Crush : Have YOU got used to people pointing the SHIT that keeps pouring<br />out of that ghastly... being you call president?
Comment 155.3	Trump thrives on them. He enjoys it when people around him fight each other and he sets them up, like the British diplomatic incident.   This is why he makes an excellent president to fight against China because he never gets tired of confrontation and we know he&#39;ll never relent.
Comment 155.4	Boo-hoo.  Get used to it!
Comment156	No class or grace at all. I’d be expelled if I behaved like Trump.
Comment157	shame on you <br />shame on you shame on you ..<br />the only thing I had to say
Comment 157.1	I guess you don&#39;t know about the Illuminati and Freemasonry!
Comment158	This shows US to the world! Well done
Comment159	I love Tramp he make me forget my all problems.please talk more.
Comment160	Piece of human excrement. No, still too high of a bar for him. The potus has no shame.. and we do not need a daycare supervisor -- He screwed up bigly and this is his performing act to his pandering, faltering sheep. No American blood was spilled ? The soldiers who fought with the Kurds consider them their brothers and sisters-- and what you do to them, you do to those who fought along side of them.  Oh- Turkey enjoyed holding our nukes for hostage and all roads lead to Putin-- every time. :(
Comment161	Somebody shoot him.There are enough guns in the states right?
Comment 161.1	All the good people who die in mass shootings and we still have this cancerous cheeto sucking putin&#39;s 🍆
Comment 161.2	You will be on the FBI watchlist.
Comment162	Is that funny?!!!
Comment163	America was once a great country now it&#39;s the enemy of the world never to be trusted and lets not forget Anne Sacoolas the killer in hiding.
Comment 163.1	Nehemiah - She didn&#39;t kill anyone, it was a car accident. You limeys are  as dumb as a rock.
Comment 163.2	@handsoffmygun MF She killed somebody with a vehicle, which may be perfectly legal in the USA but in the UK  we have things called <b>&quot;laws&quot;</b> that are designed to protect people&#39;s right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. When you do something that leads to the death of an innocent person you are supposed to show remorse and take whatever penalty is passed down by the courts. <br />But of course, &#39;Merkins are above all that, granting themselves the privilege of doing whatever they feel like, whenever they feel like, and wherever they feel like.
Comment 163.3	Anne is innocent. It was a car accident and you people need to stop trying to railroad innocent Americans.
Comment164	President Trump is too smart to get suckered into to another bs war. Apparently he is not on the mic payroll like past presidents.
Comment165	Charity begins at home, stop the massacre of Palestinians, apartheid, annexation of land and demolitions of Palestinian homes, the open air prison of Gaza! <br /><br />Israil has no moral authority to tell anyone about human rights and humanity at large.<br /><br />If their is any example of Hitler in the current World, it is HitlerNyetanyahu! Thanks president you&#39;re American president not the world mega 2020
Comment166	Finally a president who tells the truth and has the countries best interest at heart after 8 long years of sell out.
Comment 166.1	You&#39;re delusional..... And a complete imbecilic moron, just like your President!!
Comment167	Is he turning into Serizawa? <br />(Like if you get the reference)
Comment168	Troll in human skin..
Comment169	Trump didn&#39;t do Anything , Pence did it. But in trump&#39;s book &quot;The Art of the Deal&quot; there is a chapter dedicated to Taking credit for other people&#39;s hard work , right before the chapter on Blaming others for your Screw ups. You want to know Trump read his book.
Comment170	He speaks as if he’s talking to children.  The man is losing it
Comment 170.1	It says a lot about how he considers the people who supports him. I guess he tell himself he can say anything he wants as people are too stupid to see beyond his slogans.
Comment 170.2	To be fair, it was at a rally of his base. Aside from the fact that Trump has the vocabulary of a not terribly bright grade-schooler, anyone would pretty much have to speak to that group at that level for them to be able to follow along.
Comment 170.3	The worst thing is the supporters hang onto his every word.
Comment171	Not our Country! Not our problem! TRUMP 2020!!!
Comment172	please don&#39;t blame it on China again.  and say communist is evil
Comment173	Turkey wants a 20-mile safe zone at the border.  Ok, I can understand that.  But no one has explained why that zone has to be on the Syrian side of the border.  Why not on the Turkish side?  It&#39;s not a safe zone they&#39;re after....
Comment 173.1	Silkendrum - Good point. You;re right, Erdogan could create a 20 mile safe zone on the Turkey side and not have to have a war to do it. Erdogan is just using this safe zone excuse to move in and steal those oil wells in northern Syria. He&#39;s tired of buying the milk and wants to steal the cow.
Comment174	Also, it&#39;s not our business to intervene.  Just ask them!  They&#39;ll tell us to mind our own business...  which is what we should do.
Comment175	🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷
Comment176	Trump is a great leader.<br />The BBC is absolutely disgraceful trash.
Comment 176.1	That&#39;s what&#39;s great about you tube,bbc can&#39;t moderate comments like yours. And of course the are sell out liberal trash.
Comment177	I am wondering if the American are proud of Trump as a president, fight like kids!!!
Comment 177.1	I&#39;m hoping he makes it so my kid doesn&#39;t have to fight,ds. Watch some horrific WW2 films then talk about fighting there tuff boy.
Comment178	What if he wins the next election?
Comment 178.1	The USA will become an international pariah, never to be trusted again.
Comment179	Love how he lies to the gormless yet has nothing to say to the er,... gormfull?
Comment180	Trump puts us west back in the middle ages. He completely ignores international laws by making all these bullshit statements. What if now all the stronger countries decided to make safe zones inside neighboring states? Someone needs to shut Trump down before his chaotic mind triggers ww3 or something like that
Comment181	Trump for 2020❤️❤️❤️❤️
Comment182	Great Business man. Don&#39;t want to waste money. Let them kill their own kind using Chemical weapons

Comment187	Goof
Comment188	Comparing the slaughter of lives by an army 6 times the other&#39;s size to kids fighting in an ally before someone comes to break them up so they can become friends?????? What an idiotic demon!!!!
Comment189	I&#39;m supporer of him but he will not win next election, he never support his friends, he only think business and money, my GF had  money and property but he left everything when dies...
Comment190	🤦🤦🤦👎👎👎👎
Comment191	Build that wall...? 😬 lol
Comment192	You ALWAYS want them fight, if not, first give an ignition it follows then. There is and old saying here in the real center of the world (you call middle east) &quot;if two fish fight in Tigris the british is behind&quot;. Your time will also  pass away and I hope we are just a step away, you cannot fool everybody all the time. Turks and Kurds are brothers and sisters. They live here together for more than thousand years when there was no US in a better world and will again be living here together after there is no US in a better world. You win now, Will see soon that won nothing. Assalamu alaikum to all who reads.

Comment 194.2	BTC 3J8faXJCDKKS6AKvt7KNKhcEsfeKpEAShX Democrat don&#39;t shot their president...
Comment195	Weakling politics right here. You can easily see he thought up his reasonings for it after he made his decisions.<br />Basically its about money and power, but if he says that itll fall badly with his voters.

Comment 208.1	@中国是我爹, who are you referring to when you are saying &quot;they&quot;? Are you referring to the American government as a whole or different parties in America? Are you talking about democrats or Republicans? Or are you simply talking about Donald trump, in which case you should have said he and not they. Depending on who they is the answer is all different. I&#39;ll be happy to answer your question if you ask intelligent questions. Your question is way to broad and ambiguous for me to answer at this point.
Comment 208.2	KorEire Of course it is. No one in their right mind wants their fellow countrymen to be placed in harm&#39;s way
Comment 208.3	It is..... And it is not our job to police an area of the world that has been at war for 1500 years...
Comment 208.4	You don&#39;t really believe they care about human rights of other countries, do you?
Comment 208.5	short answer yes. if you are the president of the United States of America. American life and the welfare of the American people takes presidence over any other nations blood.

Comment 221.3	Lol sorry to disappoint you but the US could vote for a beggar, an infant, terrorist, and even a dead person and they’d still have more political power than 🦃..... The Dotard is obviously incompetent and racist. However, his sons, daughter, friends, and prostitutes have more political power than Turkey.....

Comment 228.1	@Waybridge LLC <br /><br />Of course, this is what we want in our country the freedom of everyone and the ruler, not religion .. Women are half of society and be free to allow between the veil tent or remove the veil.  Thank you my brother I hope to support and follow the Iraqi revolution on October 25 October ❤
Comment 228.2	Nudore Forb Hopefully the newer generations will stand up starting with the mothers to raise their sons and daughters to respect one another. The mothers must stand up and not raise their sons to believe that women are second class citizens, and mothers should raise their daughters to not take no BS disrespect from the males. Secondly, I’d abolish all religious beliefs because it backs up this aggressive male dominated mentality that craves war and power with zero compassion. It’s all starts with the mother that nurtures life itself - she raises the sons and daughters. Ultimately, she has the power and influence to change it all. The muslim religion does not support women nor this mentality. Neither does the hijab 🧕they wear because the hijab is a symbol of male domination - the more covered she was or is, the better “ownership” she had or has. That’s the true history of the hijab 🧕 Like it or not, that is the truth. It starts with women being respected and the women teaching the sons and daughters mutual respect ✊ and love ❤️

Comment 250.1	@Lenny Taylor excellent comment, well said!  You are absolutely right, The White Supremacist is stupid!  LBJ said if you take the lowest White man and convince him that he&#39;s better that the best Black he won&#39;t notice you emptying his pockets, hell he will even help you to empty them, because it gives them someone to look down on, so they can feel better about themselves!!  A majority of Trump supporters are ignorant degenerate racist Whites!!!
Comment 250.2	@BeastlyPanda Thats because he has the deplorable vote. which includes the forgotten white supremacist community.  I think Trump is smart, he manipulates them for the vote and they are too stupid and/or uneducated to see it.

Comment255	He is vulgar and very ignorant. If Drumpf was anywhere near a fight he would crap himself, he acts so hard yet he is a yellow belly clown.
Comment256	It ain&#39;t our war, BRING OUR SOLDIERS HOME.
Comment257	Could that be because there are no spoils of war opportunities, like oil, rare earth metals, gold, diamonds etc.? The country has been bombed to pieces in many areas. Another Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan story where US (along with their buddies) intervention has caused more harm than good. Or am I wrong? Who really knows the true facts about these wars anyway?
Comment258	Omg......... What kind of fxxking world are you living in??
Comment259	If the US doesn&#39;t want troops in the Middle East, it shouldn&#39;t have invaded the Middle East. Always running away when the going gets tough. Remember Vietnam? Anyone who supports Trump should be ashamed of themselves.

Comment275	What trump did was the right thing. Kurds en turks were going escalate into another war. Trump let them fight just for each party blow their steam and acting at the right time to negotiate so that both party could atleast make their point. If the war escalate too far. There would surely no stopping. Like Syrian civil war

Comment278	Make peace not war
Comment279	Erdogan will back down, eventually.  The initial sanctions and the promise of more to come, seems to have had an effect on the radical islamic leader.  There will be some skirmishes, but Erdogan did kiss The Maestro&#39;s butt.  MAGA KAG  Trump 2020

Comment283	TRUMP HAS TO GO!
Comment 283.1	I think you have to go. Go jump off a building, you butt sore swine.
Comment 283.2	@UNiCoRn PeGaSuS The dominos will no longer fall, and the ramrod will remain upright!!
Comment 283.3	Only in ur wildest dreams you commie scumbagz
Comment284	How stupid people can be??! I would laugh if it wasn&#39;t such a tragedy. &quot;Sometimes you have to let them fight.&quot; WTF????!!
Comment 284.1	Yeah, and then big daddy Trumpkins comes in and pulls the two sides apart and creates peace.  Nobel prize please!
Comment285	Well...<br />Trump has to prove to the voters in 2020 that he is a good leader and competent ... but ... I guess THAT SHIP HAS SAILED 😜✌️😝😂
Comment 285.1	That ship blew up and sunk to the bottom of the ocean.
Comment 285.2	Sailed you mean listed to the side and sank Like a Stone
Comment286	Again Trump is right - it is not America&#39;s job to police the world ... and pay for it .... and get no thanks for it .... thanks to Pro EU sorts and liberals for whom there is this warped world vision of no borders and &#39;world citizens&#39; .....
Comment287	We are past snickers and sarcastic comments about trumps ineptitude.<br />Serious disregard for the law and corruption like no one has seen. Hundreds are dead, DEAD! the GOP is all but extinct. Personal enrichment, blackmail, and our detractors are celebrating his cluelessness, and are all planning their masterstroke to take candy from the man-child who thinks he&#39;s in control.
Comment288	Here is Trump&#39;s juvenile take on the conflict between the Turks and the Kurds:  &quot;It was unconventional what I did,&quot; Trump said. &quot;Sometimes you have to let them fight a little while; then people find out how tough the fighting is ... It&#39;s like two kids ... you gotta let them fight and then you pull them apart.&quot;
Comment289	"America is a free and fair country.  2 superpower of the world with Russia. I think it&#39;s a special big responsibility for America.<br />but America made this imposition too late.Turkey nuisance because the nation is experiencing constant problems with all its neighbors and still live in the 19th century."
Comment290	&quot;...scores of Kurdish lives have already been lost, that thousands of people have fled their homes, that a swarm of Islamic State followers escaped from internment camps, that the Kurds themselves turned for help to the mass murderer Bashar al-Assad, that America’s dwindling credibility in the world was further undermined, meant nothing to the president.&quot;
Comment291	Love my president
Comment 291.1	Squat Little Witch I feel sorry for you you’re so misguided
Comment 291.2	Do not despair.  You will get the chance to visit him in prison.
Comment292	This speech will be remembered  just llike hitlers ..people  will be remembering how rich americans used  to make fun of wars ...
Comment 292.1	@Jotey Eh dude read what you written. and put in Obama instead of DT and you will throw a hissy fit. <br /><br /><br />Oh wait Obama already did that a while back. and inserted the Socom to make sure the Turks keep their end of the deal. <br />Now without Socom who is upholding the deal ?
Comment 292.2	Like Hitler? Funny, you communists love comparing the right with Nazi&#39;s, az you demonize jews, and try to do away with religion<br /><br />You people are dangerous. And the nationalist rise will be your undoing. It&#39;s just a matter of time
Comment 292.3	@Drake Hound &quot;...100 special forces to protect the Kurds&quot; from who? From who? <br /><br />The Turks. That&#39;s right, the Turks who are US allies.<br />Both sides were allies. Why would US pick a side? That would be evil.<br />If two of your friends are fighting, do you pick one to fight with and kill the other? <br /><br />No, you try to make them stop. If they start, you separate them  quickly. <br />This is exactly what DT did with the sanctions. And they did stop.
Comment 292.4	@Fumbles Pff there were only 100 special forces left to protect the Kurds with on call air support.<br />So that is too much for a Ally who paid 10k lives fighting ISIS. <br />I guess can you call your troops home from other places too ? since sometimes you need to let them fight BLA BLA ...
Comment 292.5	Rajlaxmi Dora <br />Babysitting by creating conflicts?😏😏😏
Comment293	Trump=PEACE Candidate! <br /><br />And the left can&#39;t stand it!!!
Comment 293.1	@Banksy B you mean the war that the majority of Americans were against?..the same war that lefties like yourself would have protested in the millions?
Comment 293.2	@G M <br />He is also a total coward that refused to fight in Vietnam
Comment 293.3	@G M <br />What did he achieve in Korea they still have nuclear weapons and they still threatening to use them. Asking to give him a Nobel Peace Prize you just sound like a Russian troll 😅
Comment 293.4	@Banksy B North Korea???..you mean how Trump has actually bridged the gap between a formerly hostile nation?..Trump deserves the Nobel peace prize.
Comment 293.5	@G M  not the same thing but yes he has, north Korea  Syria, and hes never leaving Afghanistan. No he is not a pro peace leader lol
Comment294	It’s amazing how many people want America to be the police of the world shake my head we should leave them all to their own devices! I’d be curious if all those people that don’t want to leave are willing to enlist in the military or encourage their sons and daughters to enlist to go fight other people‘s battles
Comment 294.1	So we can leave just as long as it’s not Trump smh 🤦‍♂️ Who cares how we leave fuck that whole region of the planet ! 🤔🤔 I’d actually be all in for being there nonstop if we got to keep the property that we were fighting over but this is all bullshit ! Let the region deal with the region and bring our citizens home
Comment 294.2	@Brendan Okeefe  Foreign policy should be handled by adults, with reasonable and responsible plans. Not by mad and impulsive dictators.
Comment 294.3	We have been in the Middle East since 2001 leaving is not irrational or impulsive !
Comment 294.4	No one wants you to police everywhere. But it is totally insane to make such impulsive and irresponsible decisions in foreign politics. There should be an adult with normal brain in the oval office. <br /><br />There are people killed because of him. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised that some groups started to plan terrorist attack against US citizens and Trump hotels just because what he did.
Comment295	more than him i am  amazed at the audience....
Comment 295.1	@edward starling do it you fuckface😆😆😆<br /><br />And then Even go to his house and then blow his cock,😆😆

Comment296	Brain dead people with Brian dead leader... Congratulations
Comment 296.1	@Dave aron You was right the first time!  Sane people usually don&#39;t follow insane people, therefore his supporters are insane, or brain dead like your original statement!
Comment 296.2	@Oxz Oz <br />Your are right... I  shouldn&#39;t call them brain dead... having said that... The man is narcissistic and Can&#39;t stand anything and must answer to every critical voice even if it comes from a child or elderly person .. Well his rhetoric might attract some people<br />But the man is dangerous
Comment 296.3	I wouldn&#39;t go that far and call his supporters braindead, you will see if he is keeping up this nonsense soon he won&#39;t have any support. See Lindsey Graham, looks he&#39;s long gone lol
Comment297	I wonder how come he hasn’t removed our 280,000 troops he just sent to Saudi?  What happened to removing our troops to the Middle East?  🤔🤔🤔
Comment 297.1	America loves the prince of Saudi Arabia and all the billionaires in the kingdom that contribute to the American economy, so when Iran starts threatening Saudi Arabia of course we sending troops over there in a heartbeat. It&#39;s all about where the money is coming from.
Comment 297.2	@Eric Rossoni Pomp and Circumstance at its greatest
Comment 297.3	100101mint mint101001 <br />But he said specifically, he wants to remove troops out of the Middle East, yet he just sent nearly 300,000 lol 🤦🏽‍♂️
Comment 297.4	He&#39;s trying to look like he&#39;s doing something and he&#39;s failing at it
Comment298	He&#39;s doing a great job.
Comment299	Anyone else remember when the lefties were anti-war? They&#39;ve literally morphed into Bushite neocons....
Comment 299.1	@BeastlyPanda No, not an army, roughly 1,000 troops but their presence kept the turks at bay lest they accidentally kill one of our soldiers which would have sparked a conflict with the U.S. The Kurds were assisting us in capturing ISIS fighters, that was why we were there, now those ISIS fighters are free to regroup and renew their terrorism against the West, all thanks to that ignorant pig in the WH.<br /><br /><br />Were you supportive of Obama when he pulled our troops out of Iraq which left the power vacuum that created ISIS? Obama believed he was doing the right thing in bringing our troops home and Conservatives called him a coward, now those same people are singing a different tune in regards to trump.
Comment 299.2	@Concrete Lightbulb it&#39;s not like it was a full army, if they stayed they would be dead as well, he moved a few troops out the way of a fight which isn&#39;t anything to do with us
Comment 299.3	Spewing your idiotic bullshit as always, I see. The Left didn&#39;t pull the handfull of American troops out of Syria allowing the Turks to roll in and slaughter the Kurds while inadvertently freeing the ISIS fighters that were captured and contained who will no doubt regroup and continue their campaign of terror against the West, all thanks to a corrupt <b>Republican</b> president who is so <i>anti-war</i> that he moved the troops into Saudi Arabia who is paying the trump administration to fight who? Yemen? Iran?
Comment 299.4	@gurugeorge Exactly
Comment 299.5	They were only anti-war so long as they thought they could get public sentiment on their side by being anti-war.

Comment 300.2	@Tiasa Dey mam it was not specific to this video but a general comment and it always give filtered information to suit it narrative and agenda again a general comment
Comment 300.3	Where did you see propaganda in this video?
Comment301	Syria and Iraq must merge to form the government of Kurdistan👍🏻
Comment 301.1	Diego Diego a few things incorrect about what you are saying. Let’s call the kettle black now shall we?<br /><br />#1 keeping Kurdistan independent. Kurdistan NEVER FORMED TO EVEN BEGIN BEING INDEPENDENT. The treaty of lausanne, recognized by all the western and eastern powers, defines the borders of Turkey and neighboring countries PROHIBITS the creation of the Kurdish state. <br /><br />#2 support for the Kurdish state within Turkey’s border is an attack OF A MEMBER OF NATO. Not just any member of NATO. The second largest ground force in NATO. One that has partaken in countless operations ranging from as recent as the war against ISIS all the way as far back as the Korean War. Taking the side of a militia which at the very least are terrorist sympathizers (PKK supporters) over a NATO member is not just irresponsible, it nullifies treaties which in turn nullifies borders set in those treaties all over the whole world. What do you have on your hand then? That’s right, a world war. One that is unprecedented. It’s almost childish to even bring the matter up.
Comment 301.2	@Black Ghost To actually keep it independent.<br />The indepedent kurdish state is under attack by ISIS, Syria and soon, Turkey.<br />Also, kurdish communities exist in more places than just the Rojava, so they fight to liberate these communities and form &quot;Great Kurdistan&quot;. Because of this, just about every neighboring nation considers them a threat.<br /><br /><br />The kurds have suffered decades of systemic opression, so an independent kurdish state (the Rojava, in this case) could very easily cause more uprisings in neighboring kurdish communites (some of wich are in Turkey, wich is why Turkey mobilized agaisn&#39;t the Rojava, since they consider it a threat that could lead to a rebellion on the kurdish communities within their borders)
Comment 301.3	@dan dag I know but that&#39;s not the Kurdistan they want and that&#39;s not the Kurdistan I meant, I meant their new Kurdistan or what they call &quot;Rojava&quot;, the one they are fighting for now. If you say that they already have it, then what are they fighting for!!!!!!???
Comment 301.4	@Black Ghost there is already an autonomous kurdistan north of iraq with own military government language and erbil as capital check out on google mongol

Comment309	We love having a president that does the right thing. The world hates the United States having a president that does the right thing. Your government has failed you and allowed you to believe that the people of the United States main objective is to care for the rest of the world unconditionally while letting their own streets decay. We will no longer allow false governments to play victim for the benefit of our hard work.
Comment310	BBC: Bolshevik Broadcasting Commies
Comment311	Well, so much for a &#39;cease fire&#39;. Fighting continues Friday. Trump may crow about President Erdogan agreeing, - perhaps someone should tell his troops they should maybe stop?
Comment312	Smh
Comment313	He&#39;s right, they&#39;ve been doing it for hundreds of years, ignorant to assume the west can solve their problems
Comment 313.1	Exactly. It&#39;s not our place, enough of our people have died trying to police the world to no avail. It&#39;s time to being them home
Comment314	*It&#39;s A &quot;Heavy Weight&quot; Political language in the World! Seriously but He meant Joking...! Please be advised of the Superpower thing!
Comment315	Trump: isis all locked up. Audience: WOAH HELL YEAH!!!
Comment316	He is a sick, sick, sicko.
Comment 316.1	@DJVEGAS1000 A lot of this is what happens when you begin an illegal war in Iraq like Bush, who was finishing what his papa started. It all gets going though with the the American apetite for cheap oil.  Blame your gas guzzlers
Comment 316.2	@DJVEGAS1000  Putin-backed Bashar al-Assad troops gained full control of the town of Manbij and surrounding areas, according to a Russian defense ministry statement published on its website.<br />The geopolitical changes have handed huge territorial gains to the pro-Moscow Assad government who opportunistically forged a new alliance with US-abandoned Kurds over the weekend.<br /><br />Basically, Russia is not helping.
Comment 316.3	@DJVEGAS1000 It is not so simple. The Kurds have been trying to fight for identity and have been continuously suppressed. They pose a threat to Turkey. They have tried to establish a democracy too, and the autocracies of the ME do not like it. They defeated the ISIS with the help of the US. Now, they guard prisons of terrorists, but lack the manpower and weapons. The US has been helping them, also keeping the ISIS at bay. The US withdrawal just messes this explosive mixture, besides showing the world America&#39;s credibility.
Comment317	My mind is absolutely blown!!!<br /><br />His “ceasefire” or “pause” is an acceptance from the US that the land owned by the Kurds will be recognised as part of Turkey<br /><br />The US “ceasefire” is quite literally agreeing to everything that Turkey wanted...<br /><br />The f*cjing raving lunatic that is now in the WH who incredibly put his name to a book called “the art of the deal” has walked to the table and asked how Turkey would like to f*ck him.....<br /><br />It’s now become a cliche, but the emperor has no clothes???<br /><br />The emperor has no spine, dick or balls either!!!<br /><br />Wake the f*ck up!!!!<br /><br />He is mentally ill
Comment 317.1	TheMetalGuy852 <br /><br />Did it matter that the Turks are a NATO ally when Trump threatened to “destroy their economy”?
Comment 317.2	Who cares? The Turks are a NATO ally and the Kurds are literally anarcho communists.....
Comment318	You stupid Muslim country think hundred time about this what Trump is saying
Comment319	Ya.. let them fight ...
Comment320	His rally supporters remind me of bobble heads! <br />Brain dead nodders who lack a spine.
Comment 320.1	@Simon Few Well-said.
Comment 320.2	@TheMetalGuy852 Also, this casual action of Trump&#39;s does put your kids&#39; security at risk.
Comment 320.3	@TheMetalGuy852 It is the &#39;world&#39; your kids live in. All lives are precious, yes. When a stronger power takes on the responsibility to fight &#39;bad&#39;, and then abandons it casually, what do you think happens? Didn&#39;t the ISIS hurt your country too?
Comment 320.4	TheMetalGuy852 <br /><br />I’ll post this up loud and clear straight off, “I don’t support China and I’m against what they do in a number of ways!”<br /><br />But in response to your comment....<br /><br />China is a Communist state...<br /><br />Therefore they can influence their economy and their laws in a way that is unimaginable to any western country.<br /><br />They fairly recently abolished their “one child” policy.... they replaced it with a two child policy<br /><br />They can manipulate their currency through state influence on their central bank in a way that western countries can’t<br /><br />They have a population of 1 billion people, over 3 times the size of the US, so their workforce is bigger<br /><br />Their economy isn’t “crashing” unless by “crashing” you mean that their annual economic growth has dropped from 15% a few years back to around 6%<br /><br />The US would kill for 6% growth... 2% is considered solid in most western economies<br /><br />And last, but maybe most importantly, jobs are NOT being lost in western economies because of China or India or Brazil, there are more jobs lost every year through automation than there are through outsourcing<br /><br />To stay on top the US needs to re-skill and be best at tech and services, screwing tops on coke bottles in a warehouse somewhere is not going to be the answer
Comment 320.5	@Tiasa Dey Exactly why I don&#39;t want to send our kids to fight and die. The world is a messed up place, and we can&#39;t possibly police it all, as proven over the last 30 years of &quot;intervention&quot;.... Enough is enough. If the rest of the world wants to blow each other up, go for it. Not my problem and not my kids&#39; problem.
Comment321	Thank you President Trump!
Comment 321.1	Are you thanking him for the racial cleansing or the fact that hundreds if not thousands of Isis Fighters are free
Comment 321.2	MAGA! Wwg1wga
Comment322	mad
Comment323	I don&#39;t always agree with Trump. But on this one I totally agree. Who says America should separate every fight around the globe. Especially considering  they&#39;ve done a terrible job for decades.
Comment 323.1	@Sarmaamy Exactly.
Comment 323.2	@Tiasa Dey  Because of its own security reason, of course. Now he put US citizens at risk.
Comment 323.3	Why did America mess with them in the first place, then?
Comment324	No words 🤬
Comment325	Absolutely no one that has ever served in the military and has had to kill someone will ever support this flippant disregard for human life....<br /><br />Yes, death is a consequence of war, but for anyone that has such a relaxed opinion of war....<br /><br />Said 10 yards away from someone and pull the trigger
Comment 325.1	Will Winn <br /><br />Trumps lucky that he has such  world class intellectuals as you....<br /><br />Otherwise he might look stupid
Comment 325.2	@Simon Few <br />Lol.. doesn&#39;t matter ..blah blah blah .. peasant
Comment 325.3	@Will Winn <br /><br /><br />Do you even know where i&#39;m from?<br /><br /><br />Or is scatter-gun xenophobic stupidity your go to response?
Comment 325.4	@Simon Few <br />American citizens don&#39;t care about you and your IGNORANT 3RD WORLD PEASANTS ..<br />Fight your own fight..

Comment 326.2	Tiasa Dey <br />Yes you are right!<br />After all,Kkeeping the Saudis happy is the bedrock of all human rights!😂😂😂
Comment 326.3	@aditya nawani Oh, to keep the Saudis happy.
Comment 326.4	Tiasa Dey <br />Humanitarian grounds?<br />Why is US allowing bombing of Yemen?😏😏😏
Comment 326.5	@Emanade No, but it is not the 30s or 40s! USA, being the only superpower, and obviously on global and humanitarian grounds, cannot just do this! And Trump definitely is a century behind his time.
Comment327	Amazing how ISIS are a protected Terrorist group &lt;&lt;&lt; TheGoyiiimOfThrones
Comment328	“Let them fight a little”<br /><br />People have died......<br /><br />What kind of maniac do you have to be to disregard human life in this way?<br /><br />He throws it out so casually...<br /><br />Whether you agree or disagree with Trump or Turkey, people have died....<br /><br />And he says “just let them fight a little bit”??<br /><br />This isn’t a human reaction.... <br /><br />People are burying their fathers, mothers, sons, daughters, brothers and sisters because of this....<br /><br />Just let them fight a bit....<br /><br />But give them top grade military equipment to do it....<br /><br />Thank f*ck the evangelicals are all on board with this....
Comment 328.1	TheMetalGuy852 <br /><br />Ok, let’s have a proper conversation, so let’s not claim “facts” when they’re not.<br /><br />It was never fully proven by UN investigators that Assad was behind chemical weapons attacks, but it was also equally never proven to be anyone else.  Will you agree to that?<br /><br />That said, the chemical weapons were owned and under the control of Assad forces and were fired against non-government forces, so the evidence against him is strong<br /><br />On the larger ME issue, I’m all in favour of not being involved, but any withdrawal, either from a single country or as a whole, needs to be managed.  Whatever the reasons might have been for being there pulling the plug too quickly creates a power vacuum, and that vacuum (from history) is filled with bad people.<br /><br />Al Queada stemmed from the Afghan Mujahideen who were fighting against the Soviets in the 80’s.  They were funded and equipped by the US.  The Soviets lost, the US immediately pulled out and anger grew...<br /><br />ISIS has developed from gaps created in Iraq and Syria after the wars there...<br /><br />Pulling out of Syria and leaving the Kurds on their own will create a new generation of anti-US terrorists.<br /><br />Even most Republican Senators are acknowledging this
Comment 328.2	@Simon Few first of, it&#39;s been proven Assad never used chemical weapons against his people. mainstream, controlled media refused to report it as it didn&#39;t fit the agenda (false flash carried out by Al-nusra linked &quot;rebels&quot;). It wouldn&#39;t have made sense anyway in an international sense as Assad was already winning the war at that point. It was just a knee jerk reaction by the neo cons and neo libs to get involved in another endless war and a reason to arm/train more ISIS and Al-Nusra linked &quot;rebels&quot; to keep the fighting going...<br /><br />the whole reason we were ME in the first place is because a bunch of neocons (Bush (Sr and Jr) Republicans) and neolibs (Obama corporate liberals) wanted to make money for their Military Industrial Complex buddies and to control the oil in the region and to act as Israel&#39;s proxy army.... So again, if it was a bad idea to get involved in the first place, why would getting out be a bad idea? It&#39;s not like there wasn&#39;t infighting in the ME before we got there..... And us being there hasn&#39;t stopped it... So what&#39;s your point?<br /><br />No one, including myself, is arguing that the US had a right to be there and that us being there didn&#39;t cause immense amounts of suffering (especially when it comes to Iraq, since the funding and manpower for the 911 attacks came from S.A.). This is <b>exactly</b> why we need to leave. NO ONE can solve the religious problems in the ME, we should only be working to contain it outside of our borders.
Comment 328.3	TheMetalGuy852 <br /><br />Where to start.....<br /><br />1.  A big part of the reason for US and international (yes France and the UK are involved to) in Syria is on the basis of Assad using chemical weapons, which have been banned under international law since just after the Second World War, so yes I do think that western “powers” should intervene when international laws have been broken<br /><br />2.  The destabilisation of parts of Syria were part stemmed and part aided by the lawlessness in Iraq, which the US AT LEAST played a part in, if wasn’t entirely responsible for, so there is a responsibility on that ground<br /><br />3.  The US had 150,000 troops in Afghanistan, but only 2,000 in Syria, so in terms of military commitment, this was tiny!!! The US currently has more troops in Germany than it has ever deployed to Syria.  Yes, every loss of life is a tragedy, but let’s put this in context<br /><br />4.  Turkey is a NATO ally, they cannot and will not act against another NATO member, so as long as the US opposed their actions and had troops on the ground, Turkey had to just shut the f**k up.  There wouldn’t be a fight because there wouldn’t be allowed to have a fight<br /><br />4.  The withdrawal of US troops supporting the Kurds sends a huge red flag to everyone in the world that the US is not a trusted ally.  Try and find a militia group in NK or Venezuela that will now trust US support<br /><br />Yes, US lives should be protected at all costs, but the damage that this has done to the US has not even started to be felt

First world means who exercise human rights all over humanity, not only in first world. You have to build a really tall wall to protect your first world otherwise few frustrated, helpless people from Middle East will create more suicide bombers and will cause more 9/11 in the future. There is nothing call 1st 2nd or 3rd world. We humans made them. Just because some people have the brain to be so conniving to mess the world’s peace and get benefitted by the chaos, that doesn’t make them immortal. How long you’re gonna live? 100 years top? These people are dying today because the chaos you 1st world morons made just because of their oil. But tomorrow you’ll die and will go to the same place they have gone. Tell your families to put some Middle Eastern oil in your dirty dead ass to the grave. Idiot

Comment 351.2	@0IIIIII The Middle East was alredy a mess before the Arab Spring.
Comment 351.3	Arfur Fuxxakes the Middle East is a mess because of the Arab Spring.  Not much to do with the US.  Syria is a dictatorship because the Baathists sided with the Soviets against the US and Israel.

Comment 361.2	@Lost Pup Do you have wet dreams about Putin?
Comment 361.3	It&#39;s extremely no fun to see your child&#39;s face blown off by the illegal use of napalm.
Comment 361.4	@Diogenes69 Wesley  I Was A Kurd. but if Trump hadn&#39;t decided to sanction Turkey, fascist Turks would have continued to kill thousands of people. I understand your reaction.you&#39;re right. but Trump was against Turkey&#39;s Erdogan since the beginning of this occupation movement even wrote her letter was slurred.let&#39;s remember that at the G-20 summit, Trump blocked the operation to Syria with a phone call.  because dictator Erdogan&#39;s army of 65 thousand people was on the border. Trump is not an enemy of the Kurds, but he may be a little unbalanced. still, sometimes he deserves to be admired for the right moves he makes.

Comment 375.1	@handsoffmygun MF Well, that is true. My comment was more of a provocation. Questioning what you people believe sometimes requires it. The thing is, I observe &quot;patterns&quot; that are very similar to those before the shit started here. Its a very crazy part of the world so one has to be on alert.
Comment 375.2	edward starling - You&#39;re right. When Saddam invaded Kuwait he took oil wells belonging to George Bush Sr. and then Bush organized a bunch of countries to join us to push Saddam out of Kuwait to get his oil wells back. Bush was one of the few people in Kuwait that owned oil wells, because most are state owned wells, owned by the Monarchy there. After this Saddam was pissed and decided to take revenge for being driven out of Kuwait. He had the 2nd largest oil reserves in the world and started flooding the market with cheap oil and driving the prices down to hurt US and UK oil companies and Bush. This caused Bush to get a UN food for oil program put on Saddam, where he could no longer sell oil, but only trade it for food for the Iraqi people. Bush was trying to stop Saddam from flooding the world market with oil and driving down prices, but it didn&#39;t work. Saddam started smuggling oil out of Iraq in trucks with secret compartments underneath, and continued to flood the market. Then when Bush Jr. got elected, he made up the lie of WMD to invade Iraq and get control of Saddam&#39;s oil and stop him from driving down prices. I can remember the day before the Iraqi invasion, gas prices had dropped to 95 cents per gallon and after the invasion they jumped to close to 4 dollars per gallon. If you think about it, our invasion of Iraq actually hurt the American consumer, because Saddam was defying opec who told him to limit production to keep the price high. His revenge on the big US oil companies was helping us to have lower prices. Like you said, Saddam was also planning to stop trading oil in dollars, which also pissed them off.
Comment 375.3	TRUMP 2020
Comment 375.4	@handsoffmygun MF then Bush invaded the middle east over the petrodollar....a bankers war.
Comment 375.5	Damian - The US didn&#39;t start anything, the Sunni and Shia have been fighting since 635 AD over who should lead the death cult after mohammed died. One tribe said the son in law should be in charge, and the other side got pissed and the war was on. They hate each others guts, and Obama should have never got us involved in the Syrian civil war.
Comment376	He didn’t read the book in his book report again.
Comment377	I have a feeling that all the people that hate Trump will probably miss him if he doesn’t get re-elected because they find it fun to mock Trump.
Comment 377.1	No.

Comment383	Some Time Let them fight, but You American Get loss from Muslim world.
Comment384	Or, sometimes you have to let Putin win.
Comment385	Soooo... Is this news?
Comment 385.1	Piccolo&#39;s Grunts <br /><br />I think the major issue with Syria is not necessarily what he’s done but how he’s done it.<br /><br />You can’t just back out of that kind of military engagement at that speed....<br /><br />When John Bolton and Lindsay Graham disagree with you, there must clearly be something wrong...<br /><br />The point is, the decision appears to have come from left field, it took the state department, the pentagon and all US allies by surprise and it was announced on Twitter....<br /><br />Even if the eventual outcome, US troops out of the ME, is the right answer, this wasn’t the way to do it
Comment 385.2	@Simon Few I can understand that. People wanted our troops to be pulled out of the Middle East for years. Trump actually has done that and now some people want us to go back there even though it&#39;s not our problem anymore. You can say I also agree with <b>Chevron</b> on this matter. Just saying I don&#39;t want 20 short news videos on &quot;Trump bad man&quot;.
Comment 385.3	Piccolo&#39;s Grunts <br /><br />Well until news channels start running a chevron reading “Trump still stupid” we have to listen to the sh*t he says....<br /><br />Personally I’m all in favour of the chevron...
Comment 385.4	@Simon Few I&#39;m just saying we know where he stands on the topic. So we should only be updated when something changes.
Comment 385.5	The words of the President of the United States?<br /><br />Yeah how stupid to think that constitutes news....<br /><br />Biggest economy....<br /><br />Biggest military....<br /><br />Who gives a f**k what he says....

Comment 400.3	@pablo9364 &quot;From the heart&quot; Haa... that&#39;s laughable! Trump talks like a toddler. The only thing that comes out of his mouth is verbal diarrhoea.
Comment 400.4	"And worse. Here&#39;s the text of a letter he sent to Turkish President Erdoğan:<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/us/politics/trump-letter-turkey.html"">https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/10/16/us/politics/trump-letter-turkey.html</a>"

Comment405	It’s difficult for me to understand this conflict!
Comment 405.1	It&#39;s old conflict since 50s 60s It&#39;s about a oil pipe line in the region. Those that want the pipeline have for decades tried to make deals with tribes in the area for land. The military is there to protect the pipelines from being destroyed by tribes not wanting to give up their land or oil for an oil pipeline.  The fight for territory in the region moves between the US and Russia. Now it&#39;s Russian Militaries turn to take care of this project.
