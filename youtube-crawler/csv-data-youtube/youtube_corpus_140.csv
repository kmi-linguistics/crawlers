Comment27	It doesn&#39;t seem to be such a bad idea. The truth is, it is more dangerous outside of those home&#39;s walls.
Comment28	Sometimes I read people&#39;s comment and am like these people need to be locked up out of the world. It&#39;s like they&#39;re not human beings. Just put yourself in the shoes of these children locked up...

Comment35	They are prepared t survive , not like us.
Comment36	Normally Dutch peoples are the most educated but this guy&#39;s are either been watching too many alien documentaries and conspiracies theories or their probably just religious hardcore. Christians or Catholic who believe in Jesus will come and probably believe the world will come to end soon believing in another false prophecies that will never come true like the rest of failed prophecies in Christianity as well theirs called historical and scientific claims which all have been debunked by modern scientists and science!
Comment37	Should have left them alone.

Comment46	God bless you all for your comments. I think they have the right to be who they want to be. I&#39;m seriously thinking of becoming isolated from this corrupt, dubious, insensitive and lonely world we live in. These guys are probably the only sane people left on planet earth. So shocked to hear a lot of people say... This is kind of life I want.
Comment47	A good way to be away from dajjal, but now it explains how dajjal will not leave a single street. May Allah protect us from the anti Christ.

Comment60	Reminds me of the movie The Village.
Comment61	You are under arrest for not entering your children into fake freedom (slavery) otherwise known as working to just make ends meet and paying your superiors a tax and never getting ahead for the rest of your life. You will serve time for not allowing your children into school to start the government program of brainwashing to make them think the way we live is normal. The first thing we will do to these now adults is sit them in front of a TV... that should do it.
Comment62	I’m surprised it took the lad 10 years to say fuck this I need a pint!

Comment73	But uh&quot;! 🍳⚖&quot;! The situation must have been massive &quot;!.
Comment74	So these people didn’t have to pay tax or council rates? Mmm I wonder why they were there
Comment75	Of course they want to keep an eye on us what we up too ....<br /><br />Leave them alone...
Comment76	I&#39;m sure they&#39;ve lived the best way of life more than any of us that think we&#39;re geniuses because of technology that actually made us all lazy in every way possible. So let them be!
Comment77	Wtf
Comment78	Finally their end times reach them  in the guise of police &amp; news channels...
Comment79	Ideal life at ideal place.
Comment80	&quot;Be one step ahead of the masses &amp; your a Genius!, be two steps ahead &amp; your a fringe nutjob!!&quot;
Comment81	Why would they arrest the man and disturbed their simple self-sustainable living???
Comment 81.1	They want his money.. think of all the tax they would have had to into the government chest..  no other reason at all.
Comment82	Where is freedom of choice 🙄 at least he saved his family from the sinful world I would love to live such life away from every crap that might wait to popup and fill your brain with every filth this world could deliver
Comment83	Are they immortal?
Comment84	They honestly weren&#39;t waiting for the end of time. As she said,&quot;it&#39;s not confirmed&quot;. So why the dirty news line?

Comment86	Classical democracy
Comment87	All this end time fack, is a big facking joke. All you religious freaks, should STFU. Nobody can tell when is the end. Period. Im sick in tired of hearing it. I hear it from my Great Grandma, Grandma, and Mom, about this end time. And yet nothing. Do you know how many Generation is that? 3. Im the 4th one. That&#39;s more then 100+ years of life, hearing the second coming ending, from different Generation. I mean, if your going to Cu.m... Cu.m already. Dont be a pervert3d b@sterd and have your Fans waiting, they might go crazy at the end. And at the end, they might not go to heaven because of waiting and making a lil sin. No happy ending. Its like a massage p@rlor story. : D
Comment88	Maybe they want it badly.. but they should wait until second coming Jesus 1st..
Comment89	So now it&#39;s a crime to live in your own house?
Comment90	How they escape electric water bills. Taxes. Surveys from nosey councils voting freaks. A dirty bearded guy wearing dirty clothes how ill they might of been?

Comment107	I bet this guy have watched &quot;blast from the past&quot;..like over and over again.
Comment108	They ar in peace..why u disturbing them with school excuse,school just a choice
Comment109	Cutie pub owner 😉
Comment110	I want to live just like these people living keep away from everyone’s bull shit and evilness
Comment111	I am from The Netherlands and this topic is big news over here. Its remarkable how different the comments are on this site than on a site from Dutch news. In the Netherlands the comments are mostly saying.....they are idiots....lock them up in prison....religious crazy ones....horrible father...poor children... etc etc. While you all are full of understanding. Weird.....one case...but different approaches dependable on what country were on.
Comment112	pub owner though 💖
Comment113	Look at the dutch trying to be like the american government how cute
Comment114	they are all sinless..<br />thanks God

Comment116	It looks like a beautiful farm . I want to live in a green place like that. But then again who knows what went on inside. I did notice another neighbor house tho
Comment117	This explains the South African bunch.

Comment120	So is this families life anyone&#39;s business??
Comment121	So is this families life anyone&#39;s business??

Comment124	&#39;Adam&#39;s Family?
Comment125	Another BBC non storey. I thought they were a public information broadcaster?!
Comment126	The Father Was On Facebook Warning People Of Spiritual Warfare Going On, A Very Humble Man Now He´ll Be Called Mental Ill As They Do To All Christians To Convince People They Don´t Exist
Comment127	Imagine. No Google search records no phone records, no trail on pornhub. What a beautiful life.
Comment128	Imagine living your whole life with the paranoia of the world ending,
Comment 128.1	@Fred I guess thats another way to look at it.
Comment 128.2	Imagine living your whole life in peace.
Comment129	Why are they arrested, leave them alone you idiots.
Comment130	Is it crime now to live peacefully away from stressful city?
Comment131	Why is this report inclined towards a crime? Im baffled. No crime has been committed so why this tone of voice BBC?
Comment132	Sure they pissed to see this mess of a world we living in 😒
Comment133	Just leave them the fxck alone.
Comment134	They lived off the grid and survived off of home grown vegetables and livestock, sounds like an amazing life! Almost Monastic.
Comment 134.1	Healthy food
Comment135	Gimme their vegetable pls
Comment136	He just wants to protect them maybe but it&#39;s their right to see that world and decide for themselves... I hope they weren&#39;t abused emotionally and physically.
Comment137	Sounds like a story you&#39;d hear about in America or Russia. But Netherlands? Quite uncanny.
Comment138	They living the lucid dream, no bills, bosses and traffic! ༼ ಥل͟ಥ ༽
Comment139	if they want to live that way,then let them
Comment140	Nut jobs: Let’s lock ourselves up for decades and await the end of times<br /><br />YouTube nut jobs: omg they’re the sane ones
Comment141	One more decade and you&#39;ll be set!!
Comment142	Your news are incomplete,, and i see your side only your story only so i do not believe your money making story,,,
Comment143	Not in Africa, OK?!
Comment144	who ,actually said they were waiting for the world to end apart from the reporter? self sufficiency is not a bad thing....
Comment145	No one discovered them or bothered<br />The oldest son went to a bar and ask for help<br />Obviously, there&#39;s something wrong in the household, or else the young man wouldn&#39;t have asked for help..
Comment146	LET THEM HIDE!! IT&#39;S THEIR CHOICE.. THEY ARE MORE PROTECTED INSIDE THEIR HOME..ANYWAY THEY&#39;RE NOT STARVING TO DEATH...WHAT THE HECK...
Comment147	The pub owner was so handsome omg
Comment148	The country is tiny. What the hell. The country is also wealthy. Is it possible that in a &quot;first world&quot; country (whatever that is) people can effectively be kept kidnapped in plain site.<br />Comebody needs to do their bloody job better.<br />Wtf
Comment149	homegrown veggies and live stock... best way of living.👌
Comment150	Plot twist:<br />A drunk kid made up lies.
Comment151	I will not be surprised to hear it was religion!
Comment152	Lmao what’s really scary is that a similar situation occurred, which was my debate topic for Honors Speech and Debate, last year. Now, it just showed up in my reccomendation
Comment153	"It&#39;s possible they know something we dont.just <a href=""http://saying.life/"">saying.life</a> is full of mystery"
Comment154	"Roof is <a href=""http://new.how/"">new.how</a>?"

Comment159	Leave them alone,and please ask them if they need some company I&#39;m planning to come join.
Comment160	Glad to see the Americas not the only place that has dumb fucks with believing the end of the world bullshit.
Comment161	They watch to much anime
Comment162	Look to the bright side they don&#39;t have to wait a lot anything...Trump got this covered..
Comment163	Didn&#39;t even know that people existed, but he went into pub and drank 5 beers?? Wtf, some BS you guys are telling here. Get your story right.
Comment164	Sounds like a propaganda event/hoax.
Comment165	Oh hell, leave them alone. It looks like they were trying to survive like the rest of us, and quite frankly, they were probably healthier since they were growing their own vegetables.
Comment166	Why was he arrested?????
Comment167	I bet they were thinking like ....the end of the world is here Hooray !!!!.....when they got found ..
Comment168	They were minding their own business eating homegrown food, staying out of trouble away from corrupt society, what crime did they commit? Why don&#39;t you let them be?
Comment169	Just leave them alone... They don&#39;t want any part of this filthy society
Comment170	Peacefull life..
Comment171	Leave them alone that  they have there own lives.... they survive many years.. they own food and water so wats the problem with that..
Comment172	why some people agreed for the kids being isolated from outside world ?? they have  right to go to school and grow up! their childhood and life has been taken away by a beast! im hapy they are safe now
Comment173	"You’d think BBC could have reported this better versus just spewing out conjecture. Edit....at least ABC Australia...across the world did a better job... <a href=""https://youtu.be/zMeLJDCXEmM"">https://youtu.be/zMeLJDCXEmM</a>"
Comment174	It looks like heaven on earth to me. Don’t you think so? Imagine growing our own veggies, eating everything fresh, no chemicals. Having to eat meat of our own livestocks. How much healthy is that. The world needs that kind of life today, self sufficient life. It reminds me of American writer, Henry David Thoreau. But what’s not so catchy is the ‘End of Times’ idea. You can’t escape it by hiding away somewhere.
Comment175	It&#39;s the effect of the movie &quot;end of days&quot; by Arnold Schwarzenegger after they watched it in 1999!
Comment176	Stop the world. I want to get off.
Comment177	I think something scared them in this world why they were making sure they locked up and secured from the danger of this world but while waiting couldn’t a bath and clean clothes been worn the Bible say come has you are but damn I think god wouldn’t mind if you clean up a bit something triggered them to want to hide and wait after all look how bad the world is today churches,schools and parties family events not even safe anymore gosh
Comment178	So sad.
Comment179	Duh he was drunk, maybe he wanted help with restrooms. There is no story here 🙄
Comment180	Hmmm. I have to find a better hiding spot.
Comment181	Fake news
Comment182	Why is police everywhere &amp; rounded off their property? Like it&#39;s a crime scene? What crime did they commit
Comment 182.1	And what law have they broken
Comment 182.2	Freedom
Comment 182.3	not gobbling down chemicals, pills and mainstream media for years is a crime, you don&#39;t know?
Comment 182.4	MD King money laundry and the fact some of the now adults where kids when they were locked
Comment183	This would be a GREAT DRAMA IF IT TRANSFORMED INTO A MOVIE😁😅<br />BASED ON TRUE INCIDENTS😃
Comment184	They disturbed this indigenous people in their natural habitat who want no social media fake news or Amazon that managed to live peacefully with nature ✌

Comment190	Sooo what did they do to the mother&#39;s corpse when she died...?
Comment191	If he went into a bar and had 5 pints   , he surely knew there was other life out there 🤣
Comment192	Evil world 🌍 an it has said in the bible Quran the world will end time is close as wats going on in the world
Comment193	If they did a health exam, they would find these children very healthy.  No refined sugar, oils or preservatives.<br />They probably all worked together to grow food, collect wood to keep warm. I dought that they said they were waiting for the end. If so they would of have sat and starved.  They prepare for winters and had been there for awhle.
Comment194	Is this now a CRIME....FOR WHAT!!!!!<br />WHY CANT PEOPLE LIVE LIKE THEY WANT.!?;?;?;!
Comment195	People interrupted that family living in peace!
Comment196	Time doesn&#39;t end people do keep listening to the lies made up by religion smh.
Comment197	Wait, you say the police wont say whether they are waiting for the end times but thats the narrative you push right? <br /><br />BBC is a known terrorist organization
Comment198	Heartiest prayers for the family..
Comment199	Who are not waiting for?
Comment200	I think they just want a peaceful and happy life, far from urban lifestyle and polluted cities
Comment201	I have more question to that pub owner. Is he single?
Comment202	Christians get dragged out of their houses and KILLED all over the world. God bless the Dutch for being kind to this Christian family.
Comment203	that house doesnt look secluded at all! 😲😲
Comment204	Freedom of expression
Comment205	Damn this reminds me of that movie that I forgot the title to lol
Comment206	It is ridiculous that people in the comments are saying they should have been just left alone and we&#39;re living a simple and peaceful life. It is child abuse to deprive kids from the outside world not to allow them to attend school. Also, there was apparently some kind of abuse going on, that went on for some time. This was clearly the work of some crazy religious cult.
Comment207	Is it a crime to live without a so called society.... Leave them alone for god sake... They are peaceful if  you never find any criminal record
Comment208	Lol wtf. Too much of apocalyptic movies.
Comment209	Looks pretty nice to me, your ever see a picture of Detroit?

Comment213	Now can feel the same when animal being locked up from their habitat
Comment214	Can someone please tell me what law they broke
Comment215	In end day&#39;s people will head for  mountains anyway good idea by this  father just because we don&#39;t all worship and follow the  mass murdering immigrant creating resource robbing leaders of present day&#39;s its cool to stay away from the twisted souls
Comment216	and what is wrong with this, the liberals turned society into shi#. Good on the father for trying.
Comment217	What exactly is end of time ?
Comment218	The blonde guy is cute
Comment219	The way the world is going and greed climate change and evil is rampant out in this world they and WE might not have to wait long for the end.😉👍🏾
Comment220	Absaloute Twaddle! Good for them.i say! .... so what if they didnt want to be part of society.... they are being treated like criminals or mental cases.... sorry but theyve got the right idea!.... The world is going to pot.... Typical BBC Reporting too.... good luck to the family if they want to be isolated thats up to them.
Comment221	They are probably safer doing that way of life than US having to deal with brexit smh
Comment222	Good on them for living a self sustained lifestyle, this will be the norm one day
Comment223	And now the police will term to their father for some charges to justify that they had saved those children. Leave them alone. They are already safe.
Comment224	Captain fantastic? Is that you?
Comment225	It&#39;s not very clear where the problem is  , if ever there was one: <br />1.  The aerial shot show formal housing and people functioning high enough to survive on organic food they produced for themselves.<br />2.  Are they abnormal by our definition only because they not buying food and water etc?<br /><br />I need much more evidence to decide whose crazy between them and  us . <br /><br /> There&#39;s too much craziness going on that pass for sanity in this western world of consumerism , big pharma,etc.<br /><br /> Some western governments are cultivating  and doing illicit trade in opium  from Afghanistan and supporting terrorism.  And in our western society this seem to have become normal. So who &#39;s crazy when many preppers are legitimately preparing for western fake petrodollar linked economies to collapse ....soon. Western propaganda make that most people considered &quot;normal &quot; have no ability to distinguish fact from propaganda. Perhaps these people are simply preppers that do not run to the mountains like US preppers can and do.
Comment226	"Oh well, They almost made it! 31st of January 2020 wasnt too far away! <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23brexit"">#brexit</a>"
Comment227	The pub owner is cute
Comment228	They are doomsday preparers. Not criminals. Leave them alone!

Comment235	i knew the comments will be interesting on this video...
Comment236	Sick people
Comment237	I thought such superstitious people are found among hindus in India but its shocking to see the abject failure of police and civil society to find counsel such fools. Holland is supposed to be a modern country.
Comment238	What crime has been committed?
Comment239	I don&#39;t understand. Is it now a crime to be isolated from the world?
Comment240	I BELIEVE    JESUS IS COMING SOON! 🙏

Comment247	Now he would now how it is to be gay drinking alcohol, drugs , buying sex etc so sad out in this world where police is killing people
Comment248	He ran away the wrong time it is the end of days
Comment249	I think they finally ran out of beer!..
Comment250	It&#39;s like the movie The Village...
Comment251	But they out now...But the end is nearing
Comment252	GMO FREE. HAHAHA

Comment281	Probably should have left them alone.
Comment282	there is no way a normal human being should ever shut his own siblings off from society and imprison them - this is treating your children like possessions and this is wrong and he should be held accountable for this. If thats his view then dont impose them on your children.

Comment298	People shouldnt be in captivity. We don&#39;t know if the dad was a nut case. Hopefully he wasn&#39;t molesting his children. If the boy was disoriented and confused at the pub, seems like somethings not right.

Comment335	If they survived for a decade.. Then I&#39;m pretty sure they have created a micro-ecosystem and they probably happy that way...why authorities poking their nose in the way someone wants to spend their life. And why they we&#39;re arrested doesn&#39;t real criminals are no more.
Comment336	Where&#39;s Kimmy?

Comment338	Zombies....!

Comment340	End of time is a most beautiful thing to happen,,,, a new age must come the kingdom of God,,, welcome it with hope and readiness in spirit,,,
Comment341	this family should be captured, hanged to death, and widely reported to the whole world in an international news for doing something so harmful to humanity such as self sufficiency, living isolated from cities and growing their own fruits.
Comment342	You mean they&#39;ve never heard of Trump? 😳
Comment343	So were they still paying household bills, water, council tax for weekly bin men to visit etc, bizarre story

Comment 351.1	😂😂👌 @kichaa13 I know right!
Comment 351.2	kichaa13 not because their self sufficient is the reason that he got arrested, it’s when you are being held prison and taken away all the freedom to go to school or be out of your house
Comment352	They are Christians, all Christians are waiting for the world to end.
Comment 352.1	AOC YEAH YOU KNOW ME 2 Doesnt matter when anyone wants it to happen God will come in his own timing

Comment 352.5	Geez... Thank you all for the interesting comments.👌👌
Comment353	They&#39;re afraid of the muslim invaders
Comment354	So what are they being arrested for not socializing
Comment 354.1	Child abuse. The man keeping them captive is not the biological father. And the young man ran away from the farm and said he needed help.
Comment355	Their peace is gone from the time they found another human.
Comment356	It&#39;s the end of the world as we know it...
Comment357	They almost made it to the end..Go back in we are on the cusp of it as we sit..lol
Comment358	kynodontas.
Comment359	Leave them alone. They are enjoying their life. Who to stop them. I don&#39;t think this is a crime to arrest them.  Love from Dimapur
Comment360	And then they saw Trump and decided to go back into hiding....
Comment361	The world is about to end so just lock the door &amp; wait for it - DUTCH FAMILY
Comment362	Crazy Dad.
Comment363	Love the homestead
Comment364	Better to live that way.
Comment365	Leave them alone
Comment366	This world is so evil..I&#39;m waiting too.
Comment 366.1	Hypocrisy Hunter The world is evil and is coming to a end soon judgment is upon us please repent and turn your life over to Christ whilst you still have time or you will be damned to a everlasting hell
Comment 366.2	Your reply to Gurinder Singh is not only inconsiderate, ignorant, misinformed, medieval, rude, ARROGANT,  BUT ALSO &quot;EVIL&quot;...UNLIKE YOUR CHRIST TEACHINGS....&quot;LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOUR AS YOURSELF&quot;<br />YOU R A PERFECT EXAMPLE OF THAT KIND OF EVIL.....LOOK DEEPLY AT YOURSELF...
Comment 366.3	World is not Evil....FANATICAL People Like YOU ARE EVIL....!!!
Comment 366.4	@Gurinder Singh what?? To get away from all the evil and go in the rapture..killing babies have you ever heard of such evil..and the evil law says it&#39;s ok to sell the baby parts... horrible..do you have a brain. .do you see what my name is?
Comment 366.5	Turn evil, you mean?
Comment367	May God bless them and take them home soon.
Comment368	The pub owner was fit AF!!!!
Comment369	And mummy&#39;s body is ...... where?
Comment370	I don&#39;t get why they got arrested, they wernt doing anything wrong! NO wonder they were living like that look at the shit we live in, I wish I could live like them. Free and no problems.
Comment371	I thought only Americans were that insane
Comment372	Whats wrong with what they did? nothing in my eyes, why should people be registered if they choose not to be, get registered the the government own you and and take your kids from you anytime they want...they all have to face Jesus one day.
Comment373	After watching too much apocalyptic movies
Comment374	Get busy living or get busy dying
Comment375	In the deep south this is normal it&#39;s called the KKK
Comment376	I’m not sure why they are being investigated. There’s nothing wrong with living in isolation.
Comment 376.1	bisquitnspanky Ok... for one, that woman in the picture is me. Two I was actually abused growing up so maybe my idea of abuse is slightly different than yours. Maybe the dad genuinely thought keeping his family from the world was protecting them. Have you noticed how much of a shit hole the world is? I never said what he did was right. So before you judge someone and call them stupid you should get to know them first. Because someone who barely survived childhood, having NDEs a few times that family sounds pretty good.
Comment 376.2	"They missed all those pills, GM food, they didn&#39;t take all those injections because they didn&#39;t go to school 😲😲<br /><a href=""http://oh.no/"">Oh.No</a> UN-AC-CEP-TA-BLE!!"
Comment 376.3	@big bruh <br />Think what you like. I am not going to argue with a narcissist.
Comment 376.4	@Clark Graham Do you think that makes a difference to me? You were implying they were jailed because they were living &quot;free&quot;. No, idiot, its because he was abusing kids/young adults.
Comment377	So it’s a crime to live off the grid
Comment 377.1	I agree, not to judge before all evidence is proved. It&#39;s not illegal not to send your children to school ect ect ect. But all children have a right to education, that&#39;s the LAW, look it up. We don&#39;t know if these children were being home schooled. My guess is they weren&#39;t. But I&#39;m all for being off the grid, and NARC free. Lol. Good luck to all. X
Comment 377.2	@ju ju right
Comment 377.3	@S Ali theres nothing wrong with not sending your kids to school.  Your only duty is to give them an education.  They may appear strange from regular folk but they obviously wanted to live differently to the rest of us.  Which is fine.  Registering births means you belong to the state.  I think they understood more about the corrupt world than most.  I think it&#39;s best not to judge as full facts arent known.
Comment 377.4	Did u only read the tittle? :P
Comment378	😀
Comment379	😀
Comment380	This is the problem of Paul&#39;s Christian religion. Denounce christianity and find truth. I suggest to learn about Islam
Comment381	What is he arrested for ?
Comment382	lesson .. dont wait for the end of the world or else you will wait  for it to come inside bars!
Comment383	Sounds like the result of religion.
Comment384	Apparently the father is a &quot;moonies&quot; who kept these kids locked up in cells while he frequently goes out to buy construction materials. He had a stroke recently which made him bedridden. One of the sons finally went into town to asked for help. Everyone who says here that &quot;they should have been left alone&quot; is a hypocrite. You don&#39;t know what kind of mental and physical abuse these kids went through. One week in there and you&#39;d be crying for your lattes and wifi. Don&#39;t give me that shit. 😂
Comment385	They shall b kept isolated until thier body gets adapted for new micribiological floraeither they r at risk/ susceptible  of infection
Comment386	BBC fake news just like CNN.
Comment387	Can’t wait to see this movie
Comment388	A decade!
Comment389	If there is no criminal records with this siblings then they live in a better world.
Comment 389.1	A healthier life style fresh veggies and farm raised animals can&#39;t go wrong there as long the kids are not abused and home schooled I don&#39;t see anything wrong.
Comment390	Nobody knows when the world will end.
Comment 390.1	I know,  the world of one ends when she or he dies
Comment391	People in US will believe anything
Comment392	Lol...western sleeper lol drunkards
Comment393	Not even that hidden tho
Comment394	Any updates?
Comment395	im waiting for the update on this news
Comment396	Hide and seek champion.
Comment397	So staying at home is a crime now
Comment 397.1	Yah..coz they are no longer paying tax..lol
Comment 397.2	@Shape-shiftingCat AndHerMinions Erm isnt that the same for religion, education, dinner, marriage etc.
Comment 397.3	Was wondering just that...!
Comment 397.4	The kids shouldn&#39;t have been forced into it as wasn&#39;t really their choice, but yep they may not come out &amp; say it but to those not coining in any money from this family they will certainly want to rapidly put a stop to that shenanigans, how dare they be self sufficient without our products &amp; services.........the sad part is now they are mixing with others &amp; consuming our toxic modern day foods, their immune systems probably won&#39;t be strong enough to deal with it so they will start to get sick
Comment 397.5	Yes...it is. So is breathing without a permit.
Comment398	How were the kids bore?
Comment399	They are saint
Comment400	Just Preppers minding their own business, what&#39;s the problem. What are the grounds for arrest? <br />These are all adults.
Comment401	Wao how many more children might be living in remotes area in the world in the  same or worst conditions. It should be invented some kind of Police census of these remotes properties were they can account for whom is living there and how. If that kid wouldnt wonder to town this secret will never be discovered.
Comment402	I think this is happening in more places than here, since trump entered into politics. He is a satan demon come to help him destroy the world.
Comment403	The time we have been living is end time as the signs Jesus mentioned in  Matthew 24, however,  no one knows the exact date,  except God the Father. <br />I think what these families need is support,  not imprisonment.
Comment404	You mean being given all vaccinations and GMOS......wow
Comment405	Humans are demons
Comment406	I watched a Greek movie like this
Comment407	Creepy shit. Try leaving them in peace, it looks like they were doing OK to me, the young man got drunk for the first time and freaked out.<br />Everyone should live free of interference from the state.
Comment408	This is so sad. Those young people have a life time to catch up but how cruel to have spent their childhood in fear.
Comment409	How it possible???
Comment410	"&quot;People will become faint out of fear and expectation of the things coming upon the inhabited earth, for the powers of the heavens will be shaken.&quot;<br />(Luke <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-pHQPWt0Sw&amp;t=21m26s"">21:26</a>)<br /><br />Got a Bible Question?"
Comment411	I love the way they lived, away from social media and bullying. Eating homegrown organic vegetables and maybe raising animals for meat. There&#39;s nothing wrong about it.
Comment412	Haha they discovered Amizon!!
Comment413	Well, he drank 5 beers... how&#39;d he pay for it??
Comment414	Lol
Comment415	I don&#39;t see why this is a problem
Comment416	why were they even arrested to begin with
Comment417	reclusive dumb ass
Comment418	Wish people would leave them alone there is obviously a reason why they hide away from the world
Comment 418.1	The young man ran away from the farm and said he needed help. Did you watch the video?
Comment 418.2	How dumb are you? I hope you do not have kids.
Comment419	They must have been watching Peaky back to back on Flix!
Comment420	Overprotective “parents”
Comment421	After 10 years with no internet , social media and TV, they are probably the only sane people on the planet. Yet they will be seen to be &#39;confused&#39; by &#39;normal&#39; insane people.
Comment 421.1	Theo Logian -funny he drank 5 beers and didnt pass out.
Comment 421.2	Lanz Monroe locking yourself away to wait for it isn’t sane no matter how you try to explain it
Comment 421.3	@PowdaToastFace Killah were all waiting for the end of time... It&#39;s quickly approaching no matter what you believe. You can look at what the Bible calla the last days (the days we are certainly living) or you can look at it as science does.... The average lifespan of a human.... End of days either way 💗
Comment 421.4	There are many people like that in the third world.
Comment 421.5	Don&#39;t believe everthing the media says or portrays as majority of the time its all fake.
Comment422	I bet this people are 100% smarter and healthier then rest of the world as soon they come out go to schools get a phone and internet then see how they will end up leave this people alone let them live how they want
Comment423	"That man at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-pHQPWt0Sw&amp;t=0m56s"">0:56</a> is Gorgeous."
Comment424	He’s never had a knob job???
Comment425	Kid had his father arrested ...way to go now society is going to come flooding into their almost perfect self sustainable world bringing rats,disease,aids  and crack !!!
Comment426	They were living like that M knight shamans movie the village ..how much you want to bet he told the younger children there was monsters beyand the woods ? Very strange .
Comment427	Smells incest is also going on.
Comment 427.1	Nica Aaaa  well the guy arrested isn’t the father and their mother died
Comment 427.2	Nica Aaaa period 😂
Comment428	Their living the dream ❤️
Comment429	Why is it illegal to live with your family outside the society?
Comment 429.1	The government own you.<br />You are their property.
Comment430	Just leave them alone if they dont want to be in the world
Comment 430.1	Jonathan Xavier your the person that told us that. Nothing in the video let us know it was all screwed up. We are all picturing an ideal scenario and now we hear it’s screwed up and your the one breaking the news and ripping us new ones for not thinking the absolute worst thing.
Comment 430.2	They didn’t choose to live that way. How can you leave them alone. That’s imprisonment
Comment 430.3	Its better than being on the streets
Comment 430.4	They were part of “the Moonies” cult. It’s a very dangerous cult to get sucked into, like most cults are (e.g. Jonestown). Hence, one of the sons asked for help
Comment431	Ten years without Facebook and Tweeter, that&#39;s a problem.
Comment432	Even the Dutch are in to those apocalyptic madness
Comment 432.1	I see nothing wrong with it...... just leve them alone.... theyblive a happy life
Comment433	Sounds like fodder for a Michael Haneke movie.
Comment434	spoiled rich country look at that house✌️<br />here in our country thats wealthy house already
Comment 434.1	Living in captivity is not fun no matter how nice your jail cell is. The young man said he needed help.
Comment435	I said it before &amp; I will keep saying it,  humans in the year 3,000 &#39;ll be searching for the lifestyle of 1950 drastically,  but they can&#39;t find it anymore because we have destroyed everything.
Comment436	I rather say fake news
Comment437	Its already a movie
Comment438	Soon they will realize there was not much in the outside world anyways.
Comment 438.1	@carmay3600 It is all plastic now, the ocean :).
Comment 438.2	Gurinder No because the other five were also in bondage. If I do not know what the ocean is and the five people living with me do not know what the ocean is. We are six people with no knowledge of the beauty, wonder and power of the ocean.
Comment 438.3	Six people living together means that each had a company of other five. So each one had contact with the outside. Isn&#39;t it?
Comment439	Probably just people that wanted to be left alone until the outside world forced itself in and jailed them for not participating in the world like us &quot;normal&quot; people.
Comment440	Fkng puddled
Comment441	So sad.
Comment442	I wont be surprised if they were listening to Harold camping.
Comment443	Typical
Comment444	He knew where is local pub was and had the knowledge and money to drink five pints 🤔
Comment445	So now the police kidnap them?<br /><br />Why should we assume there is a problem here?<br /><br />This story is to vague.<br /><br />Was there a crime comitted?<br /><br />If so, what are the details?
Comment446	BULLSHIT another fake story by BBC FAKE NEWS one of the biggest corrupt culprits there is. DONT LISTEN TO NOTHING THEY BROADCAST.
Comment447	There&#39;s got to be more to this story
Comment448	Doomsday prep
Comment449	First world countries  $ ?.
Comment450	🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
Comment451	He probably also said &quot;I need your clothes, your boots, and your motorcycle&quot;. Cigar Biker: Ha ha ha ha (burns with cigar) you forgot to say please.
Comment452	Soooo....Did they commit a crime?
Comment453	That is from the last time the Climate changed.
Comment454	Mmmm maybe I&#39;m jaded or, crazy or something, but...this is illegal how?
Comment455	planned to stay in this w/end.....now rather worried in case I get reported, and get dragged away by the PC lot / police constables and Orwellian social workers
Comment456	I envy them, happy 4them in fact <br />hopefully theyll b left living their quiet N peaceful life ❤❤❤❤❤
Comment457	Road is not far from the house, how can they still be so isolated
Comment 457.1	Mindset
Comment 457.2	People don’t really bother each other in the Netherlands + those roads are more country roads usually with a fence so you cannot just drive up there as an outsider
Comment 457.3	Because they are idiots
Comment458	The driveway was well used
Comment459	arrested ? detained ? held ?<br />on what charges ?<br />snobbing  the tulip Republic ?
Comment460	Started hiding away right about the time Barry took office in the US- seems to me they made the smart move.
Comment461	So you can live off the grid without any problem then on home grown, did not know it was against the law though, lol.
Comment 461.1	Dutch people don&#39;t necessarily have real freedom. Everything is kind of controlled.
Comment462	Which wall?
Comment463	Don&#39;t know looks like a nice place. Why can they not live the way they wish.
Comment 463.1	The young man ran away and said he needed help.
Comment464	This world offers nothing, Jesus Christ offers more love and Peace.
Comment 464.1	If this world had nothing to offer, God wouldn&#39;t still be sending babies to be born. Jesus wants you to live, to learn, to experience. Its part of your spiritual evolution. Drop your fear, you are loved. Be free to live. Namaste
Comment 464.2	Amen.
Comment465	Too much Smoking the skunk
Comment466	What right the government have to interfere with peoples choice of life?

Comment471	They can send them to Iraq or Syria for target practice as usual 😂
Comment 471.1	😢🙄
Comment472	Wait. Why is this a crime? This describes half the population in Tennessee.
Comment 472.1	@Franklin Hurst That was not an ironic statement it was a cynical one and as I said, that was opinion. I have never called anybody dumb, just their questions.
Comment 472.2	@Gareth H None of my questions are dumb.  Now, the statement &quot;home schooling of children is inferior due to indoctrination&quot; is a very ironic statement to make.  Not perceiving that might be considered &quot;dumb&quot; by some.  Not by me, since it would be ignorant to consider someone dumb I&#39;ve never met.  But some might. Have a nice day. :)
Comment 472.3	@Franklin Hurst Because homeschooling is not allowed in the Netherlands unless given extraordinary permission. Yes, there is evidence of imprisonment, that is why they have been charged. Home schooling of children is inferior due to indoctrination, though that unlike everything else here mentioned, is a matter of opinion. No, that is why I specifically said &quot;If you falsely imprison an adult&quot;. Anymore dumb questions?
Comment 472.4	@Gareth H How do you know they weren&#39;t home schooled?  Is there evidence of imprisonment?<br />Why is education in the public school system necessarily superior to the home schooling of children?<br />Most children cannot roam freely around the city.  Is the imprisonment?
Comment 472.5	@Franklin Hurst If you deny a child an education it is abuse. If you falsely imprison an adult that is also a crime. Both were possibly committed here.
Comment473	End of times Jesus coming soon
Comment474	They have neighbours so why didn&#39;t any of them ever speculate something? This seems like just a story fed to the public coz neighbours weren&#39;t worried at all so that means something right was going on unless the man wasn&#39;t really their father and the children were abducted or something similar. Were they mistreated? This story is incomplete
Comment475	Of course we are all waiting for the end of time. Who doesn&#39;t?
Comment476	The children&#39;s were aged between 18 and 25 am I right?
Comment 476.1	@Flukes L <br />Ye lol..
Comment 476.2	@Ak Jay haha. naa I had to replay it as i was so confused about children being 18 to 25. BBC confusing others for news haha
Comment 476.3	@Flukes L <br />At first she said children&#39;s aged 18 and 25. Or maybe I am deaf lol.
Comment 476.4	at first they said adult children then after said the children lol.  the youngest was 9 and the oldest was 16 if this has been going on 9 years. odd story
Comment477	What the movie 2012 had people doing😂😂

Comment479	I am sure they&#39;re healthier than all of us living in this shitty chaotic world.
Comment480	Why is this even in the news?
Comment481	So what&#39;s the crime? Saying you&#39;re waiting for the world to end? Having long hair and beard? What is it?
Comment 481.1	@Patty Daniels Well, if you kept up with the ongoing story then you would know.
Comment 481.2	Didn&#39;t say anything like that in the actual news footage...
Comment 481.3	If they were kept there as children then it was child abuse, if they were kept there against their will then it is false imprisonment. In fact two people have been charged with &quot;unlawful deprivation of liberty&quot; and money laundering.
Comment482	So what&#39;s the crime? Is there a crime?
Comment483	Their wait is allmost over.
Comment 483.1	"Gareth H I do not predict anything.I see it hapening. <a href=""https://youtu.be/HUs8f-lphec"">https://youtu.be/HUs8f-lphec</a>"
Comment 483.2	@andre cloete oooh, it must be the end times. Look at how much the lord loves you by destruction. You go and predict the end of the world and we will laugh at you when it doesn&#39;t happen. Heard it all before, so many times, your types have become ridiculous.
Comment 483.3	@Gareth H yea? That is one week. Week 45. There are 44 more just like that one for this year.

Comment 504.1	lightweight.
Comment505	This has to be fake. What about taxes, the surrounding farms, extended family???
Comment506	Who installed the Velux roof windows and the new roof on the house? This story is nonsense.
Comment507	Mole Women?
Comment508	Does this have an m knight shamalan feel? The village?
Comment509	They had it nice the government dont like it
Comment510	People are not free
Comment511	Dear BBC.... that&#39;s called living with nature
Comment512	Living off grid and home schooling children are not rare in this world. Look at their property, it doesn&#39;t look like a prison nor a garrison. The children are not &quot;locked up&quot; but were raised brainwashed and depraved. They thought what they&#39;re doing is right for their survival. They all farmed their own food and had small livestocks. The house and two other building structures are not small and cramped like how the media portrayed, it look decent from the air and organized not squalid. The eldest came to the bar twice and it&#39;s a good thing he realized there is something wrong with them and asked for help. Other than that they are living peacefully minding their own business. If the world would really end, people like them will be more likely to survive than anyone of us.
Comment513	Just leave them the way they are
Comment514	It&#39;s some sort of mental illness.  Worry and frustration.
Comment515	Reminds me of midsommar
Comment516	They probably listened to Greta.
Comment 516.1	John Williams Thank you.
Comment 516.2	john barker best comment
Comment517	I want that life 😢
Comment518	I can&#39;t blame them for opting to live in isolation, in this day and age everyone feels they need to poke their nose in other people business. Their homestead looks well taken care off. what if they were perfectly happy to live like this except for that guy who ran off? I for one wouldn&#39;t mind living like this breathing fresh air eating organic farm grown food with no stress.
Comment519	These people are my neighbors.
Comment520	Sooooo whats the problem. They wanted to be safe and away from all this worldly bs whats the crime?? Plus since the dude drink 5 beers did he have money?? ALSO after the 1st beer bartended wasn&#39;t conversating with guy that look raggedy.. If everyone was healthy and not harmed why take em from home. Seem kinda shady story.
Comment521	So sad. My relatives too. They live in the jungle waiting for the world to end.!!!! 😥😥😥
Comment 521.1	Jojo oli it&#39;s hard to explain ma&#39;am, but it&#39;s true... It&#39;s sad to see my sis and brothers, their future especially.... No education.. Etc... They sold their land long ago and live in the jungle.. Waiting for the world to end...<br /><br />I can&#39;t explain you the fact (here in the comments) but if you wish to know I&#39;m happy to share this story with you.
Comment 521.2	??
Comment522	Dwight is that you ?
Comment523	Now they will go wild and be corrupted by the wicked world
Comment 523.1	😲
Comment524	So a an arrest what was the crime. Confuse any one.
Comment 524.1	10 years of tax evasion.
Comment525	Bible stompers
Comment526	They&#39;re hiding from gay parades and ganja
Comment527	Guys, this news doesn&#39;t explain well.<br /><br />So why they were without contact is because their father was part of a Chinese cult who forced his wife and kids to join, I don&#39;t remember the exact name but it&#39;s a popular one
Comment528	Is it against law to stay away from the law
Comment529	Why wer they arrested? More harmful ppl to arrest I’m sure
Comment 529.1	@rodel victoria yeah that&#39;s true I guess to a certain extent, but it is possible to live without jobs like they were living from livestock but yeah u r right
Comment 529.2	@vickie minhas theres no harm in letting the police do their investigation afterall they are doing it to make sure there is no abusing or something bad is happening. If the police is proven wrong then they can return to their peaceful life.
Comment 529.3	@vickie minhas sooner or later they would still need to blend with society. From what im seeing they have electricity there dont know if they have tv or radio but still they arent on some tribal place so if the father dies who would pay for the electric and water bill? To earn money they need to have proper jobs and its hard to seek for one if they dont have identity(since they werent oficially registered ) or if emergency like someone got a serious illness they need to go a hospital how would they know if they are just on that backyard the whole time. The most bothering issue is if the man isnt their biological father  the chance of them being abducted is high.
Comment 529.4	@rodel victoria while I do understand what your saying and think that&#39;s a fair point, you can not exspect a child to make any kind of decision until later on teenage/adulthood years. Because children do not understand that parents do things for there best interest and half the time make bad discions. That&#39;s why we need to lovingly guide our children into the right direction. I don&#39;t know of he forced them or had a mental issue he was coping with, all I&#39;m saying is I would love to live like thay and don&#39;t see where he was wrong. According to my thinking he protected his children from our inhumane society we live in today.
Comment 529.5	@BAZXXXBEST no, you dont. You dont see this shit at all. Go read a book you uneducated degenerate.
Comment530	Some fathers have a bunch of kids and disappear, some keep them as prisoners.

Comment536	wait .  . just One more Year -Atleast . GiveOr take<br />-I Promise -Realy
Comment537	It&#39;s not against the law to live on your own but the government makes it that way by charging you taxes so they can control you you should be able to live on your own doing what you want anytime you want on your own land government is corrupt the bad thing is is the news media makes it look worse than it really is
Comment538	Dutch are weird like the kardashans
Comment539	Never mind them going to school or having a birth certificate; at least they lived healthily on home grown vegetables. Sorry about the poor lady passing!

Comment543	Yes end time is near very near
Comment544	Good on them. The BBC is a disgusting, biased publicly funded propaganda machine. For most White folks, the &quot;end&quot; has be3n a long process up to this point.
Comment545	This is someone’s tale and I sit on mine
Comment546	Christian dogma...the church has so many .misfits in all the scientific gains...it is dead and a danger to.humanity<br />Wrong polygamy in America ...

Comment554	Someday I want to live like them,, need to restore my whole being.😁
Comment 554.1	They lived in a group of six, can you tolerate five people?
Comment 554.2	Nice
Comment555	And now they will be exposed to the horrors of smart phones and modern society. They will regret it.
Comment 555.1	@harry mccc indeed
Comment 555.2	*while writing the comment on one of the main platform&#39;s for modern society
Comment 555.3	@ዝርውን በዜማ/ Prose-In-Rhythm I don&#39;t understand what you mean.  They might still regret being discovered and forced into modern society
Comment 555.4	They won&#39;t regret it, &#39;cause, it&#39;s not their decision.
Comment 555.5	🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment556	Imagine the smell from the outside and inside of the farm/house 🤢🤢🤢🤢🤢

Comment 558.1	No it won&#39;t. They are insane and so are you.
Comment559	Like uk waiting for brexit..lol
Comment560	Oh come on. Isnt the title a little too apocalyptic for someone living in a homestead or off grid.
Comment 560.1	the father was part of a chinese cult
Comment561	A movie in the waiting
Comment562	Leave them alone. they dont want the system. everybody in the new world is trap with debt. so its better to live like that. no bills to pay. just take care of yourself.
Comment563	Crazy Dutch b☆stard!!
Comment564	So just leave them alone if they want to live isolated. What happened to freedom? Or do we all have to be corporate slaves oxf the government
Comment565	I think they got used using on-line shopping that they forgot to go out. <br /><br />I bet the father has so much saving waiting for the End of the World.
Comment 565.1	😂😂😂😂😂😂
Comment 565.2	😅😂😂😂😂😂
Comment566	They were hiding away from the corrupt world we all have to endure.
Comment 566.1	Richard Wood -this proves we dont have to endure it. Just move to the country
Comment 566.2	@melvic4 I&#39;m prity shore the children didn&#39;t choose to live like that. If it&#39;s your own free choice then fine but when someone decides it for others I dont think it&#39;s so great then. The parents need locking up.
Comment 566.3	Hellen Nkirote - obviously you don&#39;t see the matter as a serious one. If that is the case on that.  Then - there is little point of arguing of it.
Comment 566.4	😅😅😅
Comment 566.5	I&#39;m not going to go off on a righteous bender on this matter - I hold to my own carefully considered and balanced view that given the circumstances I might well have made a similar choice of distancing myself from a awkward,  difficult and fallen world. All faiths and beliefs share that common theme of that as a fact. I&#39;ve seen some very intemperate language in these posts.  I believe that calming down the rhetoric and language is essential.  Let there be agreement with the common theme of the fallen and uncertain world that we all live on. I pray that we CAN all agree with that!
Comment567	It was not a Dutch family...!!!
Comment568	That homestead looks very well cared for. It&#39;s definitely not an overgrown neglected property.
Comment569	This is not new.<br />Now people are living like this all over the world.
Comment 569.1	@Rll Rll Yeah same in my home ,house     ....
Comment 569.2	Exactly it’s nothing new everyone lived like this a couple hundred years ago
Comment 569.3	@Fourcams ACCURATE ....bcz in this earth alot of people evil temptation

Comment571	Beautiful farm. Living off the land as we all should be. The isolation is bad though.
Comment572	Fallout Deutschland

Comment574	Nobody knows end time even jesus says it, the guy locked up 6 children when they could be doing something all we know the world might end 2,000y in future also I don&#39;t get how locking them up suppose to help. 🙄
Comment575	Can&#39;t they be left to wait for the end of time in peace? People are so meddling these days.
Comment576	They weren&#39;t completely isolated, the owner ran a wiki on homesteading.

C&#39;mon. There&#39;s also another small house probably not more than 300-400 FEET from theirs. Something about this story is fishy."
Comment 595.1	I think they&#39;re either over reacting, stupid, or the fact that there&#39;s not a lot of questions answered

THE TRUTH  .    the left-wing correct politics wants to keep us  stupid!                           the same left wing that keeps brexit on lock.  and the same left wing against Donald Trump. and the same left wing that are for refugees in our countries  and the same left wing that say that we the  white people are racist.  en the same left side wing that makes the crazy climate change people. the same with the left-wing schools that make climate change  propaganda.    and you know ?  it came from men and women through equal rights.     originate from left-wing womens,who abuse equal rights.

Comment 598.1	lol!!.. incel nonsense
Comment599	Very religious?
Comment600	it&#39;s not their house, the owner is arrested because he was the only one who went in and out.
Comment601	It&#39;s amazing how many people commenting are saying it&#39;s &quot;fake news&quot; If these young adults have been kept here for years and years, they probably believe they&#39;ll die if they leave. It&#39;s called brainwashing or Patty Hearst syndrome (Stockholm syndrome)  Ever heard of Michelle Knight? or Amanda Berry? These girls were kept in a home in a city and no one knew they were there. In a very rural area, it&#39;s very possible. I for one will keep an open mind before jumping to conclusions, either way. People seriously need to open their minds

Comment 628.2	@mimi duma you admire a sick cult follower who keeps children that are not his locked in a room for over 9 years? Are you a pedophile?
Comment 628.3	😐so bad
Comment 628.4	@mimi duma thats good and stuff if thats all there is to it. The catch is one of the children calls for help saying they got imprisoned and brainwashed for years so thats it.
Comment629	<b>Hmmm</b><br />So, are they living in a post apocalyptic world now?
Comment630	thats abuse
Comment631	Found a time machine in the basement. It was tuned 10 years into the future to Greta Thunberg speech.
Comment632	1. House looks well kept<br />2. They obviously go out to feed the chooks so they are not in a dungeon<br />3. How does the mayor know his wife died if no one knows who lived there?<br />4. What did they arrest him for?
Comment 632.1	Right?? I need to know why this man was arrested because with the story so far, it sounds like nothing was wrong except for the oldest asking for help
Comment633	So, is this how much individualistic Western societies are? That they don&#39;t even know or care about their neighbour at all! This is very strange and quite unpleasant, actually. I don&#39;t understand why would people not want to meet with their neighbours or at least know who their neighbours are. People always need people. You never know what for and whom you might need in the future. Neighbours can be your friends who will talk to you, help you as much as they can for anything you might need, and support and come through for you at times. We humans are social creatures, so we need to support and take care of one another in order to form a well-grounded society, to make sure everyone is safe and doing well, to feel the peace and the happiness coming from the power of company. All you care and talk about is &quot;I&quot; and &quot;me&quot; but never anyone else. This is not how a society works. It is all about egocentricism and hyper-individualism which eventually makes you so selfish and thus lonely. This is why all Westerners suffer from loneliness. You just cannot complain about why you are so lonely after isolating yourselves from anyone whom you could socialize with. There are hundreds of cases in which people die alone in their homes without their death being discovered for years after they die. This is just insane. How could you be so OK about it all? It is high time you realised that this kind of hyper-individualistic mentality is getting out of control by having been exploited a lot for decades.
Comment634	Its being reported that the Eldest, the 25yr old who raised the alarm, has a Facebook account.<br />😟
Comment 634.1	&quot;And here&#39;s a pic of me eating a plate of weeds in a cellar. And here&#39;s another pic of me eating weeds in a...&quot;

Comment641	Sounds like hippies living off the grid.
Comment 641.1	Right lol
Comment642	SO WHAT! THEY WERE LIVING OF THE GRID or FAKE NEWS
Comment 642.1	xcx23 Cwea dude chill
Comment643	Fascinating &amp; confusing. Were they being held captive by this man who is not related? What was the son drinking beer &amp; asking help for? Mental illness or cult like behavior? Maybe just a family that wanted to live off grid? Can&#39;t wait to have answers or will the end of the world come first. News shouldn&#39;t have cliff hangers!
Comment644	Molewomen
Comment645	let them live in peace
Comment646	Well, if they want to wait for the end of times, let the wait in some comfortable quiet farm.  Wait, isn&#39;t that what they were doing?
Comment647	Those truffles are strong man
Comment648	they might as well stay there, trump is bringing the end of the world very soon.... *edit: after thought, i should add trumps mini me, boris johnson is also helping to end the world.

Comment 649.3	Charlie Brown  the amish
Comment 649.4	Exactly. The turpin family for example. When you start to forget abused, homeschooled and brainwashed children then this is what happens.
Comment650	People saying how do he know beer exists well people for one beer has been here for years and im sure they had movies etc with beer in it that they watch
Comment 650.1	Nice avatar
Comment651	This pathetic case indicates a total failure by social services.<br />NO birth records????  NO education?<br />If they had no contact with the outside world, how did the guy pay for his beers?  🙄
Comment652	They went hiding too early 😂😂😂next few years they should go back lol
Comment653	End of time? No worries. We still have about 1800 years to go.
Comment654	it make sense. u can live without this stupid system.
Comment655	sick fetish austrians (Crime : Kampusch , Crime : Fritzl), every time Austrians with they secret rooms and prisons in darkness
Comment 655.1	@cUrIoUs yeas, all child are dutch in the netherlands, but the Chiefoffender is a 58 Austrian Guru ,Monster and a prisonguard
Comment 655.2	@cUrIoUs the Dutch news did you moron
Comment 655.3	@Joël Dunnink Rubbish....Yeah sure... you live down the road......NOTHING in this fake news article mentioned Austrians, or a &quot;landowner&quot;....
Comment 655.4	@cUrIoUs the land owner is Austrian.. And it isn&#39;t fake, this is 10 minutes down the road from my home
Comment 655.5	Where did you get Austrians from? This is in the Netherlands...they are DUTCH....wtf? Anyway...it&#39;s fake news...fantastic...living off grid, beautiful well cared for veggie gardens, new roof on the house, just people minding their own business......don&#39;t believe everything you see on the fake news.
Comment656	Greta thurburg spent a weekend with them  when she was 6 years old
Comment657	So after 10 years they ran out of beer?
Comment 657.1	J. d Thompson lol😂😂😂
Comment 657.2	Never heard of a prison they let you out to get beer
Comment 657.3	they ran out of yeast for the moon shine.
Comment 657.4	j.d. thompson lol
Comment658	I didn’t know staying at home was against the law.
Comment 658.1	@Jojo oli you dont have to apply for anything to home school.  I didnt.  I just rang the education authority and told them.  Obviously because my child is registered with a birth certificate I rang to let them know but these people obviously didnt have too as they didnt register the children.   All they do is pop round 3 times a year to check ya childs work that&#39;s all.   People think the way they are living is strange but that&#39;s because we are all accustomed to living a certain way that&#39;s all.
Comment 658.2	@big bruh That&#39;s what people do. They don&#39;t realize the gravity of the situation, so they comment stupid sh*t in order to sound smart.
Comment 658.3	@roger mendoza Why the fuck are you defending these idiots? Just because they were rearing livestock doesnt mean they were free to go. The kids are 18+ years old and have had 0 real medical care, no education,and likely have been psychologically/physically abused to keep them down there. They are legally adults but have not had their births registered.<br /><br />This isnt &quot;living off the grid&quot;. This is a very sick man abusing a family and you are sitting on youtube trying to justify it.
Comment 658.4	These days everything is controlled.. Yet more evidence ..if they find you busy living with too much isolation(freedom) they will find (a lie) something against you  and take away what you had . Todays evil System
Comment659	&quot;Waiting for end of time &quot; <br />I&#39;m confused😕❓
Comment660	Ik zeg     G E K O L O N I S E E R D
Comment661	Good for them that they don&#39;t have to face this cruel world
Comment 661.1	Ehm no i don&#39;t think so.. the father locked 9 children in his basement for 9 years. Now there are only 6 children left and there mom has already died. The children were held there against their will and eere told that the world was ending. Their dad literally thought he was jesus or something bc he was part of some sort of cult. Kinda creepy if you ask me........
Comment 661.2	Yeah good for them a non-biological male locked six children in a basement and they didn&#39;t escape until adulthood having been told the world was ending.... I&#39;m doubtful this story will be anything but tragic
Comment662	so it seems it is illegal to live outside of society - they where not doing anyone any harm... self sufficient.  Proof we live in a police state, we have no freedom.......
Comment663	They came out too early. Wait until we can impeach Trump and attempt to fix the shit storm he&#39;s been spreading across the world...
Comment664	Bible bashing does this to you 💀
Comment665	Weirdos
Comment666	The man who held the (indeed uneducated) kids hostage was a Austrian born man, so not really out of charater. The man who ran away was apparantly impressed by what he saw. Quite extraordinary if you think a countryside pub is something special.
Comment 666.1	duh.....this is the Netherlands.....DUTCH....not Austria, and besides, they were just living off grid....veggie garden is beautiful......cared for house, new roof...don&#39;t believe everything you see on the fake news.
Comment667	Were they part of the Kooky Klimate Kult that says the world is ending in 12 years unless we let the UN run our lives? ROFL!
Comment668	house and grounds all kept well. gimme a break with this fake news.
Comment669	We&#39;re all waiting for the world to end.
Comment670	Legend has it they took one look at the news and went straight back in to hiding
Comment 670.1	Greg L   They vowed never to deal with the BBC
Comment671	It sounds like they had a wonderful life, except for the stupid religious beliefs.....<br />     I feel sorry for the kids, having their choices taken from them, because of those bullshit religious beliefs, and this shows that humanity needs to move on, and break the religious shackles so that we stand a chance of seeing peace and freedom, for everyone........
Comment672	It seams very forward thinking, given the present state of our planet, and the clown show that is our unified governing body.
Comment673	The Pub owner is kinda CUTE😍CHRIS🇵🇭
Comment 673.1	@LsPoOKy lol
Comment 673.2	Thats my unkle bro if you dare to even touch him he has a girlfriend
Comment 673.3	Haaha
Comment674	send them to Mars now.
Comment675	Sounds like they are living like we should be. The children are grown and therefore not children, leave them be in peace.
Comment676	Folie a deux
Comment677	Excellent
Comment678	Scared of trump!!!
Comment679	They didn&#39;t miss much...
Comment680	Wrong time to come out!!
Comment681	People weren’t paying tax and living alone lol what a crime and how dare they not have internet
Comment682	Thats such bs. The roof is brand new, plastic windows, to grow vegetables you need seeds, where did he have cash from?! Nonsense story
Comment 682.1	The landowner.. He is arrested, it isn&#39;t fake
Comment683	It is so sad when people don&#39;t know Jesus. ...
Comment684	And surprised to see Trump as American president and wondering why its still not over yet
Comment685	I take it they all learned roofing as a trade. Lol what utter bull 💩<br />Surprised the BBC didn&#39;t blame it on brexit as usual.
Comment686	That pub owner is gorgeous!
Comment687	So what its their personal wish..why police will interfere?
Comment688	"&quot;The father and his 5 children were found after his eldest son&quot;  *then they continue to say they dont believe the guys the father? <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-pHQPWt0Sw&amp;t=1m37s"">1:37</a>"
Comment 688.1	Not fake news- just confusing news
Comment 688.2	It should have been. One father and 5 children (the 6 people in the celler). And another man who is the land owner.
Comment689	the father was from......Austria
Comment 689.1	@warb I know what you mean, I just didn&#39;t know the right English word.. Land renter? Josef was the one renting the farm <br /><br />Landowner has nothing to do with this
Comment 689.2	"@Joël Dunnink Not the father, but also not the landowner. A friend of the father and neighbor of their previous home (a store of wooden toys). Could be that Josef had to keep thing running after father became ill a couple of years ago. Father was also in the house. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8choPbu-VE"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z8choPbu-VE</a>"
Comment 689.3	That isn&#39;t the father, that&#39;s the landowner
Comment 689.4	and his name is......Josef
Comment690	The left is getting people to believe the world is ending.
Comment691	This is what happens when you become an insane liberal or religious believer.
Comment692	maybe im just canadian, but living alone without the endless droves of asians, living off your own food and animals seems like just about the best life possible
Comment 692.1	It&#39;s not recommended to try living off a small piece of land as shown in the vid.<br />You&#39;d be dead pretty quickly.<br />There&#39;s either lots missing from this tale, or it&#39;s b/s.
Comment693	Waiting for the end of time.  That is approximately, 5 trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion, trillion years.  Based on current cosmological estimates.  THAT is a very long time indeed.
Comment694	DAMN..! Can&#39;t even have a doomsday cult in peace now-a-days...

Comment 701.1	XD
Comment702	All Lies.
Comment703	bit odd,tere is another farm house just two fields away
Comment704	A secluded farmhouse 100m from the motorway with access to a pub....
Comment705	That’s freedom gone wrong a bit. End of time is just an expression, taking it as mental is probably why they locked themselves away!
Comment706	UN-BREAKABLE, they alive, damnit!
Comment707	What? That&#39;s why is never good to re marry because you might end up marrying crazy man or woman.😏
Comment708	Just leave them to it. They weren&#39;t missing much.
Comment 708.1	Lol
Comment 708.2	@Fuck Islam and Muslims lol
Comment 708.3	@hey hey monkey I dont see anything wrong with that.  You can register your children once they are an adult if they choose too.   The only penalty I know for not registering a child is a small fine.
Comment709	the world is not going to end
Comment710	I&#39;d love to live like this ❤
Comment711	How stupid.  Everyone knows we still have 12 years.  Ask AOC, she knows everything.
Comment712	If you watch the film, Blast from the Past 1999, you will see how this film, portrayed this sort of thing.<br /><br /><br />Its weird, that there are people out there, that did do this sort of thing, and totally separated themselves from the world.<br /><br /><br />So for people saying, it should be film, or tv ser, its already been done. A film called &quot;blast from the past (1999)&quot;, shows this virtual scenario.<br /><br /><br />I wonder what they missed.<br /><br /><br />Its just bizarre, that there has been people whom have really done this.
Comment713	Don&#39;t blame them crazy world we r in first place.
Comment714	So they were living within there own world. I&#39;m shocked that&#39;s possible .its never been optional for me.
Comment715	Idiots.
Comment716	Sounds psychotic.
Comment717	*Just be a Gentleman!
Comment718	I blame Al Gore
Comment719	They need to leave them people Along everybody ain&#39;t got to system
Comment720	I, am sure there more of this every where, take care,
Comment721	And electricity? Someone paid monthly, right? And he had cash for beers?
Comment 721.1	@laser325 Josef B. Was the land renter, he brought in materials and probably groceries. He&#39;s the only one seen leaving and entering the house
Comment 721.2	@Joël Dunnink       Possibly.<br />But it seems unlikely that they lived for years from food from that small patch of land.<br />Were they brewing their own beer as well?
Comment 721.3	@laser325 who said he is unfamiliar with beer? I get the confusion because this video only tells 20% of all information there is..<br />Maybe the reason he told it after the 5 beer is he was afraid to tell it,
Comment 721.4	@Joël Dunnink <br /><br />So the children were imprisoned?<br />It seems strange that the pub-goer didn&#39;t tell this information first before his five beers.<br />It also seems strange that somebody unfamiliar with alcohol could drink five beers.<br />Beer is very strong to those unfamiliar with it.
Comment 721.5	@Bob Courboin the story only gets weirder, the home renter knew the family for years, they had a wood work company together, one day in 2010 they moved to a small village, &quot;Ruinerwold&quot;, they didn&#39;t tell anybody and just &quot;disappeared&quot;,<br /><br />There has been some cult stuff going on in the family, they had very strict rules (notice, the 58 year old renter isn&#39;t part of the family, but a close family friend).<br /><br />The father of the family got sick, the renter took care of food and stuff like I said, he is now arrested because he isn&#39;t cooperating with police investigation
Comment722	Well.... why can;t they live the way they want?  I guess the crime is they weren’t;t serving as active servants to fueling some economy. We can’t let people do that. People are a valuable resource to be mined by governments and corporations.
Comment723	My country just keeps on surprising mw
Comment724	This story confused the hell out of me, and there was way too many things that did not make sense what so ever. After some thinking, I have gathered the people in this story were NOT held against their will, or hostages, but crazy nuts with tin foil hats waiting for what they thought would be the ending of the world...... So therefore, they lived like hermits, and did not go anywhere. There you guys go.
Comment 724.1	I am dutch, and i watched some report on it last night. They were part of some kind of religious sect that believed the world was ending, the strange thing is that some of the children were registered at birth and some werent. The father of the children is very sick so he is stuck in bed and the mother died long ago. I think their parents hold them in theor house all of their lives and got them to believe their story of the end of the world but because the father got sick and he coukdnt control the children anymore they went into that basement
Comment725	Strange how this got so much attention, yet nothing about the Dutch farmers protests...🤔
Comment726	this story doesn&#39;t add up in a lots of ways , Mother died in 2004 , 15 years ago , which make the youngest just 3 years old back then <br />plus each child that is born have to be registrated , so that is impossible ,  then when the father moved with 5 or 6 children in 2008 <br />that doesn&#39;t goes unnoticed were was the CPS ? when the children didn&#39;t went to a &quot; new &quot; school <br />as the Netherlands is to small to go off radar completely especially with such amount of children <br />since the CPS system from the Neterlands is almost in everybodies family business since 2002 <br />this story will give the CPS more rights to get into all the families that lives in the Netherlands for sure <br />to monitorized each family 24 hours a day , sounds like those children were from a breeder and are now to old and young adults <br />as it also reminds me to that weird Turpin story from the states
Comment727	They were waiting for the EU to collapse

Comment 728.4	And this is the start of another meme.
Comment729	I find it hard to believe that this household was left untouched by officials for years.  Didn&#39;t they have to pay taxes?  Did no one make a welfare check to see if they were safe?
Comment730	Privacy a crime now
Comment731	Maybe they should have stayed there. According to Extinction Rebellion they didn&#39;t have long to wait for the end of the world.

Comment748	&quot;Speculation&quot;...so, there&#39;s literally nothing but a random guess behind this title...<br />...but it helps to make some people who weren&#39;t plugged into state ed. &amp; twitter look insane.<br />Lived for years sustainably off a small patch of land, and you&#39;re instantaneously off on cultist implications.<br />Maybe go screw yourself.
Comment 748.1	lol the state&#39;s services put young men &amp; women in unimaginable nightmare-situations constantly; up to &amp; including violence &amp; rape, then hides &amp; excuses these things (often using this news service). They demean cultures &amp; the very idea of family itself. So, the point is they&#39;re playing their propaganda game and admit they&#39;re doing it on speculation (that their endless power grab benefits from). Take a look around with an eye for anywhere you disagree that ceding community to government is a bad idea, and you&#39;ll start to see instances of that pressure.
Comment 748.2	@Concrete Lightbulb ,out of beer apparently.
Comment 748.3	Why would the young man ask for help if life on that farm was blissful?
Comment749	Probably going to be the best beer advert ever.

Comment754	Shouldn&#39;t the headline be: Dutch man kept his children hostage for decades ?
Comment755	So we don&#39;t yet know why they were living in seclusion, and this hasn&#39;t been investigated yet...  but regardless, you report that they were waiting for the world to end. Great job BBC.
Comment 755.1	Do keep up, it was what the young man told the barman according to what the barman has said when was interviewed!
Comment756	bbc what you could have hidden in that place
Comment757	When it’s a crime to secure yourself away from society...  Bet they are in re-education camps now.  Leave people alone !!!!

Comment759	People going places once they got invited to Ellen
Comment760	Bunch of crap.  You can clearly see the road with busy traffic and still &quot;not clear if they knew other people even existed&quot;?
Comment 760.1	"Joël Dunnink <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3-pHQPWt0Sw&amp;t=0m26s"">0:26</a> looks like traffic to me"
Comment 760.2	Those are police cars
Comment 760.3	@Apocalypse Witch its definitely fishy
Comment 760.4	But they didnt leave the room in 9 years so they wouldn&#39;t have seen the traffic.. I just dont know how he didnt go to school because he would have been 16 at captivity
Comment 760.5	@Apocalypse Witch They did knew. One of the people (a 25 year old man) even had his own company to sell heaters and was active in multiple social media platforms. This was the same man who came to that pub a few times. Due to privacy reasons they have not gave information about the other people until police investigators know more about their true story.<br /><br />Some of the photos on his instagram are photos of the town ruinerwold during that night. The idea that they were creeping around at night makes it all extra creepy. Especially since i live a few km away from ther as well.

Why you are picking this family out and making a scene about them and the way they are living only shows what you are truly HIDING! 👀👌🏽

Comment 781.2	The children weren’t allowed to leave the premises so were basically imprisoned. They were lead to believe that the world had ended and they were the last surviving (that’s a lot of mental trauma especially considering they were quite young when all of this started), all the windows were boarded up so they had no connection to the outside world, didn’t go to school so aren’t educated, the condition and state of the house was rough. So yea, against the law

Comment790	How sad that religious fanaticism has damaged these children for life. I mean, they’re adults and they have never had a childhood!
Comment791	they seem to be well off to have built that home.  they&#39;re not bothering anyone and they&#39;re completely independent     ...what&#39;s the problem?? why interfere in their privacy?? you&#39;re lacking taxpayers is it?
Comment 791.1	That fact that they&#39;re not registered is the main issue here
Comment 791.2	One of them walked into a pub and asked for help. If they&#39;re waiting for the &quot;end of time&quot; and none of the kids have been registered, seems pretty obvious they have not be raised in a sane, healthy environment.
Comment792	Future Netflix docuseries
Comment 792.1	A whole cult called the Maansekte (Dutch) or the Unification movement (English) is behind this. Creator of this sect is somebody who also owns or owned the Washington Post. So this is becoming a much bigger story now.<br />That land owner apears to be a Austrian man and met with the father someday when they lived somewhere else. Later they moved to that farm.<br />The Austrian also owned a toystore and was closed for years, but had always payed the rent till this day. Like why the fuck?

Comment 795.2	@NinPien he&#39;s not the father!
Comment 795.3	@laser325 he is not the father
Comment 795.4	Bbc news gotta be taken with a lot of salt.
Comment 795.5	Definitely thought the same
Comment796	Waiting for the world to end, should never be about hiding out. It&#39;s about sharing the good news of Jesus Christ with others, so that they may be saved. I do believe we are in the end days, which is even more of a reason to share Jesus.<br /><br />YOU ARE LOVED...<br />God loves you and desires for you to spend eternity with Him, however, SIN has seperated you from God and from entering Heaven (If you have ever lied, you have sinned, making you are a sinner). That is why God sent His Son Jesus Christ to save you, to rescue you from the punishment of sin, eternal Hell. You can not get to Heaven on your own accord... Your good deeds, being a good person, your church, your money... Can not save you... Only Jesus Christ can save you!!!<br /><br />WHAT TO DO...<br />Go to Jesus Christ with a humble heart. Repent of your sins and put your trust in Jesus Christ as your Lord and Savior.<br /><br />AN EXAMPLE PRAYER:<br />Jesus Christ, I come to you a sinner, I repent of all my sins and ask for your forgiveness. I believe you are the Son of God, that you went to the cross, died in my place, paying my sin debt and that you were buried &amp; rose on the 3rd day to everlasting life. Jesus, right now, I choose to receive you as my Lord and my Savior, trusting in you alone for my salvation. I surrender my life to you and ask for your will to be done. I invite your Holy Spirit to come into my heart to make me more like you. Thank you for your forgiveness. Thank you for filling me with the Holy Spirit and for your gift of eternal life in Heaven. Amen!<br /><br />NOW WHAT:<br />Being a Christian is all about relationship. You grow in your relationship with God as you spend time with Him, in your Bible, in prayer, in time of worship and praise. I suggest reading the gospel of John first, and then read the books that apostle Paul wrote, Romans through Philemon. Apostle Paul was chosen by God to reach the gentiles (all non Jews).
Comment 796.1	@Cindy Rose  I have read the bible many, many times. At least a dozen different translations and in 3 different languages. It&#39;s still an atrocity.<br />  Incest, is not OK. Owning people as property, is not OK. Murdering helpless women, children, infants and the elderly is not OK. Selling your daughter into sex slavery, is not OK. Vicarious redemption through human sacrifice,  definitely is not OK.<br />  I could go on for pages, but I&#39;m sure you get the gist.
Comment 796.2	@Cindy Rose Talking snakes? Rules for the care and keeping of slaves? No thanks. 👎
Comment 796.3	@Susse Kind He has, he has given you His word the Bible. I pray you will take the time to read it.
Comment 796.4	There are just some people who are just afraid of the world and wanting the end times that&#39;s probably their case
Comment 796.5	Thank you, sister! I meet you in Haeven 🤗
Comment797	He knew beer existed...
Comment 797.1	They must have made home brew and be used to alcohol or you couldn&#39;t drink five pints if it was your first ever time. No way.
Comment 797.2	@Joshuahikes <br />And I think they got the electricity for their DVD from their solar panels
Comment 797.3	He probably lost mom at 9. He was not imprisoned his entire life
Comment 797.4	🍯 blood honey 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Comment 797.5	@Universum <br />I see your comment is 2 weeks old, so not sure why this story has come up on YouTube&#39;s front page for me today (?); but the BBC&#39;s YouTube channel is absolutely crap.<br /><br />Technically, the BBC is (sort of) &#39;owned&#39; by the British public/ government- although it&#39;s independent <b>from</b> the government.  In the UK we have to pay a TV licence fee which (partially) funds the BBC. This applies whether you watch it on a tv or any other kind of device.<br /><br />The licence fee lets you watch BBC iplayer, which is unavailable (legally) in other countries. So much of the content that is made for the British site isn&#39;t allowed to be shown internationally because it&#39;s the British people who pay the licence fee.<br /><br />More recently,  they&#39;ve started trying to get onto YouTube, but it&#39;s with shitty clips like this and links to their actual news stories under the videos. <br /><br />I personally think it&#39;s a massive failure; everything seems superficial and with very little detail included.<br /><br />They&#39;d be better using their international set-up, showing adverts (because of the licence fee, in the UK, there are no adverts on the BBC) before clips and using &#39;international audience news&#39; which is different. <br /><br />Or they could <b>hire</b> someone who could actually advise them in how to do this properly. The BBC used to be such a good source of news. These days it&#39;s pretty pathetic.

Comment 809.1	&quot;I have two children, aged 20 and 30.&quot; They are not children, but they are MY children.
Comment 809.2	It&#39;s reality in the Netherlands. I&#39;m 22 years old girl and nobody takes me seriously. I feel like a baby. My friends between 22-25 still study at college

Comment 810.3	@hobo dog Most religious folks that I am familiar with don&#39;t. They interpret the Bible in such a way to reinforce what they want to believe. See the modern day American evangelicals who made Jesus into a gun toting, white Republican. 😲
Comment 810.4	@hobo dog so they listened  to  the father😞😞😞
Comment 810.5	You and the 4 kids. No one has any idea.
