Comment18	So sad. I met the Queen, that was not the Queen, it was a hand puppet. For all her years, it comes down to this, this is what she is now, not a monarch, but a mouthpiece. So sad. She was quite a woman, now she will be remembered for this. So sad.

Comment28	This old women is a Devil freemason i&#39;am sorry to say that but their is no democracy in UK<br />Even if we are optimistic, it is a stolen democracy!
Comment 28.1	"@Roland <br />I heard that too lol 😁"
Comment 28.2	@ SUV Tucson but I heard that they are a country of &quot;Sovereign&quot;!😁🤗🥰
Comment29	UK monarchy is a fake glamour tale Democracy is globalisation unity in diversity Educated middle class is realistic
Comment30	The constitutional monarchy is the result of the compromise of the bourgeoisie to the landlord class. Although it can develop in advance, it will eventually lag behind the world. The fact that there are only the British and the monarchy in the five permanent members is a very ironic thing.
Comment31	Brexit <br />In:like<br />Out:dislike
Comment32	It&#39;s very obvious the Queen wants Brexit. So no more voting. No more pointless debate. Just exit.
Comment33	The bbc is a pedophile corrupt buissneess and edits and makes a news headline out of false news

Comment 40.1	Death to Queen 👵🐖
Comment41	Hello
Comment42	YooKai is in turmoiiiiil
Comment43	&quot;Without being chauvinistic&quot;<br />Translation:. &quot;Ensuring our friends in High Places continue to ensure their incomes by disallowing mothers to stay at home with their children, by way of rigorous propaganda aimed at shaming women who would do so.  Further: We will continue to apply small fire quenches to the gargantuan problems inherent in this sentiment, furthering our ignorant causality of continuing to keep CHAVS a quintessential part of CHAuVEniSm, due to our foolishly misguided love of money before work ethic in our own Circles.  Thank You.&quot;
Comment44	august 2050 . UK will leave the EU at the end of the month
Comment45	Queen se poes
Comment46	I parodied a song of Imagine Dragons - Believer to believe her starring Queen Elizabeth II
Comment47	The British have always been insular, not only geographically but also in spirit. Back in the day they had no qualms about colonizing others  but they showed feebleness when the cards ‘seemed’ to turn on them. Anyways, they will still be part of our European culture, even after the brexit .
Comment48	Maybe uk should not leave eu for its own good
Comment 48.1	Possibly you are very right.
Comment49	Boris is likely to go down in history as one of UKs greatest PM if he can implement brexit on the 31st October deadline, with or without a deal.. I personally hope he achieves it without a deal. It will lesd way to the signing of new trade treaties with and for the rest of the world. Europe hss for too long shafted and benefited from tarriffs and embargos that have directly hindered the development of many countries in Africaa under their colonial ties. ( Walter Rodney How Europe underdeveloped Africa.) Its time for there to be a fairer redistribution of wealth this is  natural evolution and Great Britain is once again the fore runner  God save the Queen.
Comment50	Nazi alien
Comment51	Corbyns poetic style is sickly and disgusting not one of standing
Comment52	Boris and Corbyn are both shady jews. One&#39;s a banker, the other a commie
Comment53	The Queen and Boris Johnson are impressive, while the opposition and some media people come across as Snickering Fools.!! Your Queen has been through the mill and yet she stands poised and strong. Have faith in her and in Mother 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 England.<br /><br />🇦🇺 Watching with deep interest...

Comment69	left-wing propaganda.. not news
Comment70	God save our Queen.
Comment71	An observation from across the pond. Only a small part of your government gives a darn what the people of England wanted and voted for. You think you have a representative democracy but from where I sit, it seems like you have a bunch of entitled Liberals that think they are dukes and duchesses and should run your lives because you don&#39;t know any better. I guess its global. We have the same problem in DC with only Trump and a handful of Republicans representing the people and not the swamp. When it comes to London, it has gone downhill a lot in the last 10 years.

Comment78	Of course the liberal party is against it. They only respect their own opinions and not those of the people!
Comment79	Britex, God save the Queen.
Comment80	How absurd for a monarch to make references to &#39;democracy&#39;.
Comment81	How can Johnson dare to instrumentalize the Queen for his dumb policies ?!?
Comment82	This woman runs the world. This woman is the most powerful person in the world.

Comment86	Year is 2019, yet their still is a queen... can y&#39;all open your eyes?
Comment 86.1	@Jason Kirk who gives a shit about your DNA heritage ? Why are you immediately assuming we are marxists or globalists ? What is so bad about these 2 philosophies that you could explain ?
Comment 86.2	@anti zion so tell me how your Globalist, Marxist world will fix everything? Lol this should be good
Comment 86.3	@anti zion and Merkel isn&#39;t?

Comment 87.1	Queen is a dirty pig 🐖
Comment88	Be thankful that you don&#39;t have to live in the US right now.  The Queen is one tough lady.  We are stuck with an orange imbecile who wouldn&#39;t know his butt from a hole in the ground.  Can I come over and live with you guys?
Comment89	Attention White people all over the WORLD,why in Hell are you allowing yourselves to be replaced,do you NOT have any self preservation bones in your collective body at all?You need to learn from Mr.Orban of Hungary.
Comment90	Hope that Brexit will happen before the Queen&#39;s death due to old age 😆😆😆
Comment91	Who cares about what the queen says? <br />It is absurd we still have the monarchy in this day and age.
Comment 91.1	We? are you British?
Comment92	EU must get rid of CHF this time but try to keep UK as one of it&#39;s most valued members ones. There is no value for my vision of the new EU system to keep CHF, but for the US the CHF system seems to be the perfect partner this time.
Comment93	Has the Queen started wearing a wig? She looks like she is wearing a wig.
Comment 93.1	Either she&#39;s wearing a wig or she isn&#39;t. Nothing good or bad about it. It was just an curious observation. No need to get so PC you snowflake.
Comment 93.2	Does it matter - Remember in today’s world you can be who or what you what to be -
Comment94	I miss playing popolous sometimes, I would like to design a new version of it in 2020, if we could get a new Silicon Valley in the EU, which the UK should be also a part of, I hope. My version of popolous would be a very different one. Imagine a small universe, where can only life at maximum like 10 000 different systems and each time if that universe reaches that mark, a global cataclysmic self learning process will be activated which will take as long time as there are more than the 11 systems left, the goal of that self learning cataclysmic process should be to decimate those weaklings sort of systems as fast as possible until there are left only 11 of them, the strongest ones, which will now again have time to spread and fill their universe, and the only and the most deeply rooted values of the 11 ones should always stay the same, to reach that magic number of 10 000, where they could witness a new form of that historic event, with all it&#39;s blood and all it&#39;s gore, which actually might next time even be of their own existency the end.🤖
Comment 94.1	Can you imagine this, completely formulated in platonic machine language?
Comment95	Can you stop disturbing the Queen with your cactus 🌵 voice
Comment96	Ok Remainers.<br />We have the UK Public, the PM, and HRH The Queen on one side for Brexit.<br />On the other we have you, the Elites, Media, and 60% of Parliament .<br /><br />I&#39;d say your side lost.<br /><br />Can&#39;t wait to see you come out against Her Majesty.<br /><br />Have at it...
Comment97	God save the Queen
Comment98	propaganda machine bbc wants another referendum keep going to elections till your agenda is achived
Comment99	The Labour Leader has never supported what any of the 2 or 3 government before the present Prime Minister.  The opposition has always wanted to oust out the Prime Minister with a resignation.
Comment100	The Queen should retire . time for new King
Comment101	BBC: Brexit dominates Queen&#39;s speech<br /><br />Sky News: Crime dominates Queen&#39;s speech

Comment114	What a ridiculous circus act and waste of tax payers money. Brexit is a few weeks away and we get a show with a crown on a pillow from an out of date monarchy. What complete bollocks
Comment115	Who cares
Comment116	The Queen should stand ashamed for wearing a crown adorned with diamonds looted from India and Africa. Return the Koh e noor to India, its rightful owner.
Comment 116.1	who gave you peaceful independence? are you angry you weren&#39;t ruled by a caliphate? if the monarchy was restored and not ruined by marxists, the commonwealth would have been the place to live in, so long as it stays with those borders
Comment117	it&#39;s not a monarch, its just a tool for the media to manipulate and mock and then eventually get a ideological leftist as monarch to give non stop airtime to.
Comment118	how corbyn can be silent about something he had always been against before the EU labour should be pushing for far better training in trade skills for our kids ,how many nurse&#39;s could have been trained by now to replace the foriegn nurse&#39;s who should be working in thier own countries where they are in desparet need of them and will always be looking for the best wage possible , usual agency work that only adds to the NHS problems and means higher costs overall

Comment157	It&#39;s like the opposition is taking crazy pills.  They are so out of touch with the people. What about the referendum and the promise to follow the results of said election.  Democracy is at stake
Comment 157.1	If you really believed in democracy you&#39;d be asking for a second referendum. 2 years have passed since the vote and it isn&#39;t fair to hold the people to a choice made not just less information than we have now, but false information spread by multiple sides.<br /><br /><br />In any good legal system a choice is not counted as a free one if a person is lied to or doesn&#39;t know the results, the idea that this shouldn&#39;t apply when the whole country is at stake is ridiculous.

Comment171	I’m British, I work in the Netherlands. I’ve travelled all over Europe. I can guarantee, the quality of life is better in Europe than in the UK. It’s fairer, it pays more, it gives you more chances, more opportunities, more freedom and a welcoming society that treats everybody fairly and equally. I can tell you right now, Brexit is going to ruin a lot of young people’s lives in a very painful and constricting way. Right now I have the freedom to travel anywhere across the 27 nations.

Other than that it is basically a low pay system. <br />Portugal is a shame and people get paid a joke, in Spain the payment is on par with the cost, in France the same and if you are an immigrant that work there you better just work and save the money because if you get to have a little fun then you might just have staid in you original home country, Italy is on amounts of debt that are abysmal , Greece , welll, not even comment. <br />You work on the godamn Netherlands, one of the few countries that are stable and your taxes go to pay the immigrants ( muslims in high numbers ) that don&#39;t work.<br />You just travel all over Europe as a godamn turist you idiotic person, you don&#39;t know the harsh of life just because you go see a few monument in other countries and pretend that Europe is all cumbaia.<br />Is people like you that don&#39;t understand jack shit that are ruining Europe.<br />Idiot !

Comment180	If they stop Brexit, I&#39;ll force my way into a Europe and demand equal rights freedom that is enjoyed by Europeans. The freedom that these occupiers will deny people like me in my own homeland!
Comment 180.1	I&#39;m sorry? All the stuff provided to EU citizens by the EU is the same across countries in the EU. It&#39;s not some situation where Britain gives something to people from other countries and they don&#39;t give anything back. That would be ridiculous.<br />Is this what people who want to leave the EU believe? Who told you these lies?
Comment181	Some one is trying to cause some chaos.I wonder who? Let&#39;s just say they have wormed there way in the government and are causing confusion. Am I the only one who can see this.
Comment182	hello I am French and I wanted to say to the English peoples this : <br />Well before the negotiations for brexit begin with the European Union, one had to be absolutely convinced that the debates and the negotiations would take place in the dishonesty of Europe! because for Europe it&#39;s absolutely necessary to punish the English ! it is an obligation for Europe, according for Europe the brexit MUST be an economic disaster for the english and that&#39;s why the brexit must be as hardest as possible!.....<br />if the brexit is an upturn for the English economy and if everything goes well for england it will be a disaster for Europe, many other countries will want to leave the EU .... but most of all, people of the other countries of Europe will realize that they have been lied for 25 years at least !....that&#39;s why, according to Europe, England must suffer an economic tragedy!....<br />so these negotiations are not real negotiations, it&#39;s an effort on the part of European politics troops to corner england, everything is done so that england loses at the end of the course! <br />but I have confidence in the English people,.... I trust the English people, because, as Charles Gave say, &quot;my grandfather always told the English lose all battles but win all wars !)....<br />joke aside, this time again the English people will win! you will regain your sovereignty and the mastery of your economy, without the orders of Europe .... you will recover your identity that Europe is trying to annihilate by all means ... and I&#39;m happy for you! 3 years already that Europe plays you a piece of music upside down, constantly pushing the deadline ..... 3 years already that you said NO to Europe ... 3 long years !!!<br />Once again europe will do everything to postpone the deadline .... in the hope that the english will tire of this incessant uncertainty, and that perhaps, one day it redoes a referendum.<br />We know the problem in France because in 2005 we said NO to the European constitution in a referendum ! but two years after the Sarkosy government has voted a treaty that bypasses the decision of the French by applying almost identical rules, it is the Treaty of Lisbon ... a betrayal, once again of our politicians! they also did the same thing to the Danes and many other countries!  it&#39;s a fascist Europe ... a dictatorship.<br />Stay firm, stay the course, keep your courage intact .... long live the brexit, long live England !! .... and i want a FREXIT !!!! quick !!<br /><br />bonjour, je suis français et je voulais dire ceci au peuple britannique :<br />Bien avant que les négociations pour le BREXIT ne soient entamées avec l&#39;union européenne, il fallait déjà être absolument convaincu que les négociations seraient placées sous le signe de la malhonnêteté de la part de l&#39;europe et de ses dirigeants. Car pour l&#39;europe il est vital et absolument nécessaire de punir l&#39;Angleterre, que celle-ci paie le prix fort pour sa sortie de l&#39;union; pour l&#39;europe le BREXIT doit être un désastre pour l&#39;économie anglaise, il faut que le BREXIT soit le plus dur et contraignant possible! ....car si le BREXIT est une embellie pour l&#39;économie britannique et si le BREXIT se passe bien, ce serait une vitrine pour d&#39;autres pays européens qui deviendraient désireux de sortir à leur tour de l&#39;union européenne, mais surtout les européens eux-mêmes réaliseraient enfin qu&#39;on leur a menti pendant 25 ans au moins ! c&#39;est pourquoi l&#39;europe souhaite que ce BREXIT soit pour les britanniques une véritable tragédie. Ces négociations ne sont donc pas de véritables négociations, c&#39;est un effort désespéré pour mettre l&#39;Angleterre au ban des nations et tout a été mis en oeuvre pour qu&#39;elle perde au bout de ce processus de sortie. Mais j&#39;ai confiance dans le peuple britannique, car comme Charles Gave le dit &quot;mon grand-père m&#39;a toujours dit, les anglais perdent toutes les batailles mais gagnent toutes les guerres, parfois ils gagnent mais c&#39;est par accident ou par chance !&quot;...blague à part, cette fois encore le peuple britannique vaincra, vous regagnerez votre souveraineté et redeviendrez maître de votre économie, sans les incessants ordres impératifs de l&#39;europe....vous vous réapproprirez votre identité que l&#39;europe tente de détruire, de disloquer et d&#39;anéantir par tous les moyens....et je suis content pour vous ! 3 ans déjà que l&#39;europe vous joue ce pitoyable refrain repoussant sans cesse l&#39;échéance de votre sortie de l&#39;union.....3 ans déjà que vous avez dit NON à l&#39;europe...3 longues années !<br />Une fois encore l&#39;europe fera tout pour faire reporter le BREXIT, dans l&#39;espoir que ce faisant, les anglais oublieront petit à petit cette &quot;malheureuse&quot; initiative et se lasseront de cette incertitude permanente, et qu&#39;enfin un jour ils refassent un référendum.<br />Nous connaissons ce problème en France car en 2005 nous français, avions dit NON dans un référendum sur la constitution européenne ! mais deux ans plus tard le gouvernement sarkosy a fait voter un traité pour contourner cette décision du peuple, un traité qui reprend mot pour mot et presque à la virgule les textes de la constitution européenne que les français avaient refusés, ce fut le traité de Lisbonne....une trahison, une fois encore de nos politiciens européistes ! ils ont fait la même chose aux danois et à bien d&#39;autres pays de l&#39;union....c&#39;est une europe fasciste....une dictature.<br />Amis anglais, restez ferme, gardez le cap, conservez intact votre courage....vive le BREXIT, vive l&#39;Angleterre !!....et je veux un FREXIT !!  vite !!

Comment 182.3	"@Matthias Darrington ........well no! ..... the proof has just been given to us on Friday 18 September .... an agreement having been found for the borders in Ireland and Calais there was, again, this minority of British politicians totally acquired to Europe and pro-Euro which blocks all the processes of exit of the EU .... it is a dictatorship, it does not want to respect the will of their people ..... it wants once again to rot the negotiations, to repel the deadlines, or even propose a new vote ..... it&#39;s a scandal."
Comment 182.4	This is bullshit. France and Europe more generally has every economic interest in a free market and free movement. That&#39;s why Brexit and the UK is treated as a potential partner. However, the UK has unreasonable political demands that stop this from happening, such as closing the Irish border for people but not for trade, which just cannot work ! Same for Calais !

Comment187	Imagine the next Queen&#39;s Speech, if she says her government will do a third referendum, and this time brexit really does mean brexit.
Comment 187.1	Lol we just would have fourth and fifth, brexit means brexit, at least we know with this new labour and liberal Democrats, don&#39;t respect the votes.

Comment220	Respect the will of people and their Queen.
Comment 220.1	@Eoin Campbell I&#39;m not against democracy, I&#39;m just against transforming good monarchs in puppets. The following monarchs will use their powers wisely because of the parliamentary tradition the U.K has and I&#39;m not asking too much. I&#39;m asking for her to have a suspensive veto at her own discretion, for her to have the power to dissolve parliament and call election. Basic things every monarch should have. She can&#39;t even do those things. And also, and elected official doesn&#39;t really make them accountable to the people,that is why we have corrupt politicians that only look to their own interests. Interestingly enough she is more accountable to her people than the PM,that is why she need to maintain high popularity because if not the people will force her to abdicate.
Comment 220.2	Amin Do Nascimento Soares Feres Just because the people have some power doesn’t mean giving a single unelected official specific powers doesn’t undermine democracy and it definitely doesn’t mean it’s a good idea.<br /><br />Maybe you would like if Queen Elizabeth has more power but there is no guarantee that later monarchs would use that power as well as she hypothetically would.<br /><br />There is good reason why the world has moved towards democracy, let’s not regress just because some things have gone wrong.
Comment 220.3	@Eoin Campbell She really should have more powers but that doesn&#39;t undermine democracy because the people still rule through parliament and also through referendums. She just really should act to safeguard her country&#39;s best interests
Comment 220.4	Will of Russia&#39;s misinformation campaign :p
Comment 220.5	I love how the people who say that we have to go through with Brexit because of the democracy of the referendum also believe that a single person like the Queen should have more power than everyone else by birthright.<br />Really makes it easy to see your beliefs are hogwash.

Comment 246.2	She wasn&#39;t... Who will care more for a country than some who DEPENDS on the best for the country? Politicians come and go, they lie, they just want power for pay, they will choose party over the people (as we can plainly see) our Monarch personally cares and is, by birth, dependant on her subjects and their success.<br /><br />That is why we love her,its better to have a head of state that truly cares (and pays their way now I might add) than money-grabbing, idiological nitwits playing games.
Comment247	I love the Queen but she doesn&#39;t sound well, and her speeches don&#39;t mean nothing to normal working people.

They say they must keep Ireland and Scotland under there control but won&#39;t accept being part of the larger EU Control. This is all about making decisions using the ego of a few instead of wisdom of the many. Just like in Russia, N. Korea, and China. Bad example to the rest of the world.

My mom&#39;s father was a Douglas and his family history was traced back to the 1200s in Scotland. It is said that some of those distant ancestors played a part in betraying Mary Queen of Scots who was then beheaded. That is as close as they got to any royalty. LOL

Comment 257.1	@Murphy Mary it is good that the people is serious about taking back their rights and heritage. The Queen and the people are hand in glove on this. As long as UK is able to take back control of their own future, the people with prayer will regain their identitiy and rebuild heritage for the people are strong/diligent/courageous and will &#39;rebuild&#39; the nation despite the fear.
Comment 257.2	I Tan Our government sold us out 40 beats ago with one small form - now we have a liberty of books full of agreements  - that the people never knew existed until Brexit comedy they put us through giving us false hopes - when 75% of our rebel MPs voted in Parliament in their own interests not in the interest of the people huge majority legal vote - we will not be cheated by our government

Comment272	The parliamentarians in the United Kingdom act like children.  This is the only dignified part of the year.  Usually they yell at each other and grandstand.  They argue about the dumbest things and jeer for no reason rather than trying to show some class.  It is all about racebaiting now and poverty pimping.  The  upper classes are the dumbest bourgeois bohemian idiots in the world probably.

Comment275	I really think u should allow the queen to read her own speech, or just get rid of that all. She is a puppet that is not even allowed an opinion.
Comment276	I wonder if Ms. Queen would consider taking the American colonies back under the British wing.  America hasn&#39;t done so well with its independence.  Especially lately.
Comment 276.1	@T Beck If you respected the choice, why was there a war?  Anyway,  I&#39;ll take it up with our representatives.  LOL
Comment 276.2	Absolutely not, we in the UK have no interest in colonialism anymore. However, where our colonies have been we do want to regain strong ties and commerce.<br /><br />Reinvigorate the commonwealth and the USA can join in as a special partner. We respect the USA&#39;s Republic, it was their choice.
Comment277	If it weren&#39;t for conservatives there would be nothing consevered and everyone would have nothing so quit acting as if conservatism is a bad thing; or would you rather piss everything away into the dark and not have a window to throw it out of; myself I love being conservative without conservatism I&#39;d be broke all yr long and I like to be able to eat when I&#39;m hungry.

Comment 297.3	@John D What does Hong Kong independence had to do this? Back Off! Why should we care of a small island in Asia when UK government is in chaos and to dictate by Eu?
Comment 297.4	@NVOG You are a paranoid mess if you think the EU wants to take power away from any country or if you think they have done so. Note that even the people who like the general idea of the EU critique for being <b>too weak</b> not too powerful. Learn the facts and stop spreading your nonsense conspiracy theories.
Comment298	&quot;High wages and low tax&quot; hahaha who will work if foreigners will be kicked?

Comment301	Why am i even watching this for time passing?? Iam from Pakistan😄
Comment 301.1	@popkahchinafter ww2 and in 1965 when UK was suffering from labour shortages in industrial area they took workers from Pakistani cities mirpur and Jhelum because those workers were working under a British company for the construction of mangla dam in Pakistan. If it wasn&#39;t for those Pakistanis UK would probably be a poor country by now and those who are settling down in UK are families of those workers. My own half of family is living there for decades and it&#39;s there choice. Now even if any Pakistani is going there for settlement is graduated and taking part in the country&#39;s growth. I don&#39;t know what drugs you&#39;re on but you certainly don&#39;t have any knowledge of history and the change of human settlements around the globe. Humans have been migrating from one land to another land from the beggining. What guarantee do you have that your kids or grand kids will not move to another country?. Use your commom sense mate
Comment 301.2	@Shahzad Ali said this to your fellow pakistani friends^^ why and why and why are they doing everything to get in there? 😂😂 Just making themselves cheap lol
Comment 301.3	@popkahchin i don&#39;t wanna live in that box of wood. Iam far better living in here, why would i want to live in a little house where you can&#39;t even see sunshine for most of the year. Mountains, snow, desert, forests, beaches, you name it we have it then why would i let my self living on a puny island😂. Iam proud on those foreigners who are living in UK because what damage that country did to the rest of the world have to be recovered some way😄. Keep dreaming of your self that your country is great but times have changed so does the perspectives and now that island controls nothing than just some poor Africans resources
Comment 301.4	because you are definitely gonna smuggle yourself or trying anything to take advantage of the loopholes of the UK law just to live in the UK like many pakistanis and indians are doing now.

What if we POISON, then KIDNAP and illegally hold hostage 2 UK tourists in Moscow, and then BLAME M-6? Don&#39;t you think that all powerful GRU can do something like that rather EASILY? <br /><br />Now, what&#39;s going on with Brexit? Did the TYRANTS that oppressed you for centuries, want to now STEAL your DEMOCRACY? Why do i get the feeling that its time to invade your island, so that DEMOCRACY could be saved? <br /><br />Anyway, im pretty sure that i just heard a loud YES to the Invasion Option, i will report your request to Russian Parliament, we will see if we could maybe combine 2 operations in 1: 1) Recover our 2 poisoned and then kidnapped citizens; 2) Recover the Rule of Democracy for British People and Her Majesty. <br />Always happy to serve the progressive humanity, u welcome!

Comment344	I have been watching brexit news for a while... correct me if Im wrong, it seems to me that they did all these mess on brexit because they want to control on their immigration and borders??
Comment 344.1	Mikko Lodeon In a manner of speaking yes Britain wants control over immigration and their borders which they can’t have under the EU due to free movement and trade. But there’s a lot more to it than just that.

Comment 347.3	@Fonzie Thank you for the backhanded compliment. I left skool at 15 and worked for 50 years and still working. Firstly you&#39;ll be dead before 70, you&#39;re bones will give up as well as your daft brain. Secondly it is &quot;You are&quot;, or You&#39;re. Not your as in &quot;his&quot;, or &quot;their&#39;s&quot;. but you&#39;re as in mine, or I am.<br />So nice one chummy! You looked a plonker twice over (That is two times to you).<br />I think the teachers were just teachers 50 years ago and not scared to slap our stroppy time wasting arses down and they were not trying to shag us and be our friends unlike that nice mincing music teacher Mr Rollover, nice man and giggler extraordinaire. <br />I am a much better man for having &quot;Nosher&quot; Grisdale give me 6 of the best 2 times a week for 2 years. Whereas my sons and anyone under 45 have the squiched brains of a hair chat. Over to you Johnny!.....

Comment 372.5	@Christopher Poole <br />Dream on...<br />Have you seen the level of the pound, for example?<br />Trump and BJ have had negotiations to make Britain a US trade-dependent annex following Brexit.
Comment373	That guy with that smirk on his face I just want to slap him in the face and take his country from him he better be lucky I’m not here to do that
Comment374	I&#39;m still waiting for Parliament to be sacked and for more power to be restored to the Monarchy...
Comment 374.1	Quite so, the advantages are obvious and overwhelming. <br /><br />Firstly this is the only solution to eliminate division and to establish a central form of government across Her Majesty&#39;s 16 realms. As an Australian I can tell you that this nation is a rich first world country and this does mean that it has a duty to economically prioritise assistance to poor and developing Commonwealth realm countries such as Jamaica, Papua New Guinea, and of course the UK.<br /><br />Secondly, a Monarchy which is legally recognized as being the sovereign is more representative of true democracy as this is in line with most people&#39;s wishes.<br /><br />Thirdly, representative democracy serves the person at the very best only 49% of the time due to party conflicts; therefore we already only have limited democracy. The monarch can choose to keep these Democratic systems in place to delegate power to (voluntarily) which would almost certainly be the case anyway; the only difference is the restructuring in law to leave no doubt that it is the Monarch which is sovereign and not Parliament.<br /><br />Fourthly, a Monarchy would allow for better long term assurance of stability across countries in regards to many common issues such as free trade and freedom of movement; instead of a new ignorant government coming along and unilaterally altering or negating such agreements overnight.<br /><br />Fifthly, who would you rather vote for, some random self serving nobody like Donald Duck busy lining his own pockets through corruption behind a massive smoke screen as we speak; perhaps some random wannabe named Matthias Darrington; or a true global figure who is globally respected and admired where people would bend over backwards for them; a leader with lifelong upbringing, connections and contact like no other?? The answer is overwhelmingly obvious and most people agree ..
Comment 374.2	@John D Could you please detail the advantages of a monarchy with respect to a democracy or technocracy ?
Comment 374.3	@Matthias Darrington I&#39;m not a Conservative though; I am a Monarchist

Comment 374.5	@You Tube Your mum is a definition of a depressive regime. Get fucked
Comment375	England is fortunate to have a monarch who cares for the will of her people and for democracy. Britannia rule the world.
Comment 375.1	@Kenneth Gitau Hong Kong flourished under English Common Law as did Singapore. If Hong Kong wasn&#39;t a British territory they&#39;d have had their culture and people raped and tortured by Maoism like the rest of China. India still uses Common Law and the Westminster Parliament System. Britain, along with the Commonwealth fought the Axis and saved the world from Fascism. And did they let go of the colonies without violence? Ghandi was an adulterer and sexually abused many of his followers. Not everyone is perfect. But I&#39;ll be grateful for the good of Britain and let go of the bad, as it was in the past and those ideas are dead. But the ideas that live are a force for good.
Comment 375.2	@Calero Calero oh dear.  Ever heard a blessing in disguise?. Your talking point on how British has good Civic principals is not only ironic but also short sited. Here&#39;s why. Shashi Thahoor was asked on the benefit of the Railway system the British developed in Colonial India and his reply was, the rail was just meant to transport materials from the Indian countryside to the ports. While it&#39;s still being used , the reasons that saw it&#39;s construction are totally different. The cost of which is a massive disenfranchisement of societies who were unified. Just like India and Pakistan and the haste to divide the colony along religious lines , Hong Kong came under the same fate , So did Singapore.
Comment 375.3	@Kenneth Gitau But that&#39;s never going to happen. And they wouldn&#39;t exist if it weren&#39;t for Britain. And they owe the freedoms that are being taken away by the Chinese to Britain. You&#39;ve got me thinking now about Singapore and how that&#39;s a pretty nice place too. Perhaps the British have a few good civic principals that have had a positive effect around the world?
Comment 375.4	@Calero Calero am not so sure. Hong Kong would like being sovereign
Comment 375.5	​@Kenneth Gitau Hong Kong would be happy to be back in the Commonwealth right now.
Comment376	Have to have balance queen much love to ya wow what grace
Comment377	Who in their right mind would want to stay in the failing EU. The Queen looked pretty &quot;not amused&quot;.  I am not surprised at all as the House of Lords and MPs swear allegiance to the Queen and didn&#39;t accept her first speech .She had to come herself to shut them all up  and keep the constitution going.

Comment383	Maybe the time has come for England to get rid of their monarchs and become a modern country.
Comment384	As an American, I was very surprised by their level of contempt toward their 93 year old queen. It&#39;s shameful.<br />Brexit or no Brexit -- whatever the heck that is. It sounds like a breakfast cereal to me.

Comment386	The world is in awe of England&#39;s heritage and culture, but England is ashamed of itself. Marxism is a cancer that eats a nation&#39;s self-esteem from within.
Comment 386.1	Calero Calero <br /><br />Well said. However, I will interject that it is Britain as a whole that has been divided and cowed, not just England. The majority of Scots have been thoroughly indoctrinated (though to be fair to the people I live amongst 40 percent of them did vote to leave the German engine of subjugation) and unionists in NI have been pushed to the side. Before somebody claims I am some Orange reactionary, I am a Catholic Iraqi Chaldean immigrant and I detest this. The atheist left is using the Catholic and Prot conflict, and is even exploiting the Muslims, to divide the British further so they can enforce their sick and godless agenda upon us all. The left is only taking us further towards the abyss, hopefully our side will be able to take us back.

Comment399	&quot;Yank&quot; here. Looks like I just took a time trip back to the year 1619 or something. Interesting.
Comment 399.1	@Just a human Being never forget the Hindu kush. Circa 80 million killed over 200 years when Earth&#39;s population was under 1 billion.
Comment 399.2	@My 2nd amendment is a right not a need Hear hear I am all for the first two amendments and they should be enshrined thought the commonwealths constitutions in my opinion as they are what truly sets an individual free. However, I also like a monarchy due to the fact if you have a family as the head of state you have someone at the top that cares about families and what&#39;s more important to society than healthy families. Also, we have people who are groomed from birth to be good leaders as the head of state. Your presidential quality can be a lottery especially if its a democrat. Both the president and the queen have exactly the same checks and balances. In fact, I would say that the upper and lower houses have more clout over the queen than what the house of representatives and senate does over the president.
Comment 399.3	Andrew Murray - Having a monarchy dictate the laws that I am forced to live by, is not something I would like, but to each his own. If you&#39;re happy with it, good for you. Your Constitutional Monarchy might be stable right now, but in centuries past it was tyrannical. They had offensive speech laws and were imprisoning people for what they said ,that the government decided was offensive, and it&#39;s the reason we have a 1st amendment freedom of speech protection, where we cannot be imprisoned for what we say. It&#39;s a tool that these regimes use to imprison and silence people that protest against their rule. Just like the dictator Erdogan said in a speech the other day, he said he was arresting people on social media for spreading propaganda about his invasion into Syria. He even sent the police to a journalists home and arrested him for criticizing the invasion. Those people were expressing their opinions or thoughts that contradicted Erdogan, so they were branded as criminals and thrown in prison. It&#39;s how dictators stay in power, by criminalizing speech and criminalizing gun ownership. The people are then powerless to say or do anything against the oppressive rule. The problem with a Constitutional Monarchy is that your head of state is born into the position and not elected. You can sugar coat them and call them Kings or Queens, but they&#39;re just dictators. Right now your head of state dictator is the Queen and she is not tyrannical, but what happens 50 or 100 years down the road when someone like Stalin is born into the family and starts dictating the laws that govern over you? A Constitutional Republic is what we have and it was formed in  protest to your Constitutional Monarchy. The way I look at it is, to each his own and as long as you&#39;re happy with your form of government and I&#39;m happy with mine, we&#39;re doing alright.
Comment 399.4	@My 2nd amendment is a right not a needneed what would be worse is if commonwealth governments could make any laws they wanted such as say stupid laws such as forcing people to say particular things. Wish she had struck down the preferred pronoun law. There is a massive difference between the Queen of England and the king of the camel jockeys in Arab land. Don&#39;t see people getting limbs hacked off in Piccadilly now do we? Constitutional Monarchy is the most stable political system. Americas fractured system is about to descend into civil war!

Après le climat il n&#39;y à pas que la fête des citrouilles.  October 31 would decide on the exit of Europe. That is to say for centuries Europe would die for Europe in family wars.

Comment 453.4	@Amin Do Nascimento Soares Feres people can&#39;t get rid so easily of their monarchs, because they are the tip of an iceberg baaed on privilege and those who benefit don&#39;t want things to change.<br /><br />Historically, they have always been forced out of power after a violent event, a war or a revolution.
Comment 453.5	@Manuele Mambelli You don&#39;t need an exact number of supporters to know someone has their general support. If modern day monarchs are in power is because their people want to,that&#39;s is a Fact, I just set the example of Liechtenstein

Comment475	BBC propaganda please UK regain your freedom and fuck the monetary gain it&#39;s not equal to Britain&#39;s sovereignty. If not the EU will ruin your country by over populating Britain with muslims etc... and cheap labour. The EU only cares about $$$ mirants=cheap labor,crime and oppression  from elitist/EU/Nazis
Comment476	Imagine that, the UK liberal party against punishment for violent criminals, and all in for wave upon wave of migrants abusing welfare and handing over completely sovereignty to Germany...I believe the former leader of Germany from the last century would be quite proud of the current roster of U.K. liberals and national socialists...I believe that former German leader had an acronym for national socialists like yourselves and the complicit BBC
Comment477	Britain the &quot; greatest place on earth to live&quot;.  Talk about delusional ? For who is he speaking ? For the oligarchs that&#39;s who !
Comment 477.1	GARY GRAY That’s is why all immigrants try to make their way from France
Comment 477.2	Barbara C <br /><br />The communist drones such as yourself have been trained better. You seem to have a hivemind. Incredible. However, we should send you back to the shadows from whence you came. Or maybe quarantine you until the disease leaves your putrid body. However, something tells me either method wouldn’t help your degeneracy. Good luck.
Comment 477.3	The peasants have been trained very well.
Comment 477.4	No, To the people of this country the people who are patriotic, The people who love our Queen, <br />You will never understand, <br />So why bother even listening? Oh so you can spew you&#39;re jealousy,  <br />Long Live our Wonderful Queen, ❤️❤️❤️

Comment480	Johnson is delusional:  all smart buisnses ARE / OR HAVE moved to Belgium and Amsterdam.  Tories - and Johnson, a hideously sociopathic JOKE.
Comment481	Queen 💓❤💓
Comment482	Imagine that, the liberals in the U.K. hate the idea of punishing criminals, stopping the influx of third workers looking for a free ride, and in favor handing over complete power and sovereignty to to Germany.  Hitler would be proud of the U.K.’s national socialist...I believe he had an acronym for that
Comment483	The British Dynastic Monarchy is incompatible with 21st century humanity :  the french and Italians abolished of this horrid institution century&#39;s ago.   frightening actually.
Comment 483.1	Marius M <br /><br />France - 150 years ago.<br /><br />Italy - 80 years ago. The king Vittorio Emmanuelle III was heavily involved in the overthrow of Mussolini along with Pietro Badoglio. Voted out because he allowed the ascension of the fascists - narrowly, funnily enough.<br /><br />Greece - 50 years ago. Voted out because he allowed the ascension of the military junta.<br /><br />Romania - Commies<br /><br />Russia - Commies<br /><br />Yugoslavia - Commies<br /><br />Iraq - inevitable overthrow<br /><br />Syria - inevitable overthrow<br /><br />Jordan - inevitable overthrow- if it wasn’t for Israeli support. Still there<br /><br />Kuwait - still there<br /><br />Bahrain - still there<br /><br />Oman - still there<br /><br />UAE - still there<br /><br />Qatar - still there<br /><br />Saudis - still there<br /><br />Spain - After the reinstatement of the monarchy and the ascension of Juan Carlos, he immediately disassembled the apparatuses of the Franco regime and held elections. Still there<br /><br />Sweden - still there <br /><br />Denmark - still there<br /><br />Norway - still there<br /><br />Netherlands - still there<br /><br />Belgium - still there<br /><br />Luxembourg - still there<br /><br />Japan - still there<br /><br />Portugal - taken out, because it was ineffective, and replaced by a piece of shit government that was so ineffective that it had to be overthrown again and replaced by an authoritarian regime, that actually did well. Ie, the beautiful and sexy Salazar. Good going.<br /><br />Seems to me that a republic provides no advantage whatsoever, and that they are not as common in the old world as you would like to believe. Give me an actual argument this time.
Comment 483.2	What are you banging on about the modern world is fukef
Comment 483.3	the effects of populism as introduced by modern democracies has completely changed the intellectual nature of democratic politics in the last century or so. I dont know if it&#39;s for the better. Europe voted politicians that were pro reckless immigration that resulted in a rather unseemly crime and dependency increase wave that threatens many of their entire welfare systems. Social dems in Britain are so left leaning their police and politicians have overlooked, aided and abetted the child gang rape enslavement of tens if not hundreds of thousands of their girl children by disgustingly sexist, racist and primitive cultures grotesquely overrepresented in these hideous crimes for the sake of political correctness. As an Asian brown man that could pass as middle eastern, I would take America&#39;s bluntness, mass shootings, and greater conservatism any day over the horrific shame that Brits have brought to the civilized world. A more disgusting and sudden fall from grace I&#39;ve never seen. All this for the sake of left populist cultural marxism. I would much rather the crown have gotten involved with investigating this national shame of Britain sooner as they are the natural allies of the most downtrodden, indeed the traditional alliance in feudal politics was the faith in the Queen the lowest serfs had; they have replaced a city council but only after a whole generation of rape genocide inflicted on their most vulnerable children; the swift powers afforded a monarch were truly what was needed and applied but there was so much bureaucratic, media and political red tape the authorities were not even aware of the scale of the issue till recently. That is a perfect example of where a ruling oligarchy whose existence is explicitly tied to the national identity and social body of their people was able to effect a necessary and drastic response, indeed should have been granted and hopefully is currently implementing greater powers and abilities to fight this. Politicians are not interested in honor or the most downtrodden; a social elite subjected to the most rigorous standards, not choosing power but having it thrust on them, is the much better mechanism imo.

Comment 487.1	@laser325 Before any trade with US was mentioned it was Australia that were the first to want to make trade deals with UK there will be no problems getting trade deals with other countries Japan even want to trade and many others, in fact in the earlier stages after the Brexit vote Parliament were thinking Britain could be the next big trading hub, everyone want&#39;s to trade with UK. Short term UK may suffer a little after UK leaves but long term it will prosper.
Comment 487.2	Dream on, Muhammad, Britain&#39;s economy is going to be fxxxed for the foreseeable future unless Trump&#39;s deal with BJ goes through, which will make Britain a US trade-dependent annex.

Comment 501.2	They won&#39;t.   They leave it worn for  tradition.
Comment502	So Boris used the Queen speech as his party&#39;s political broadcast. Poor Liz as  Boris&#39; s glove puppet, with a speech he wrote her outlining the things he has no intention of doing.  Come on Boris, thats not the right way to use the Queen.
Comment 502.1	He didn&#39;t do the glove puppet trick on her, they&#39;re related. That would be sick. Although, she is married to her cousin.....🤔...
Comment503	"<a href=""https://youtu.be/OeJpRHBK1vI"">https://youtu.be/OeJpRHBK1vI</a>"
Comment504	I loved the Queen’s poker faced, stiff upper lip, “I’m reading Boris Johnson’s speech” delivery.
Comment 504.1	@laser325 Family ties mean nothing to real life experience.  If you watched your cousin slaughter your people im pretty sure you would not think kindly of them. Also she loses power to the EU any queen in her right mind would seek to get that back.
Comment 504.2	@Under Ruze             You do know that the Royal&#39;s real surname is Saxe-Coburg-Gotha?<br />It&#39;s doubtful they are anti-German.<br />(Phillipo&#39;s real name is Phillipo Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg. He adopted his mother&#39;s surname of Battenburg, which was then anglicised to Mountbatten.)
Comment 504.3	That is exactly what it is.
Comment 504.4	@Fonzie Inferred reply. Not ignorant.<br /><br />And no, surprise would require you were capable of cognitive dissonance. As you&#39;re not capable of cognition, I can&#39;t see how it could be dissonant.
Comment 504.5	@Sam Hale You think that ignorant reply will surprise  me ?
Comment505	Lol look at these people.

Comment 507.2	I too + can make = meaningless statements
Comment 507.3	Thanks for the dismissive comment that doesn&#39;t solve anything and strokes your own ego. Have a nice day.
Comment508	This is worthless. And useless speech.👈👀
Comment509	They voted to exit.<br />I thought a civilized democratic country the majority counts?<br />So whats the problem now?<br /><br />So, i guess UK IS NOT CIVILIZED... a thug country.
Comment 509.1	I completely agree with you there
Comment 509.2	@chris jones The right decision is give Scotland and Ireland full autonomy and sovereignty and work together from there. If it was real democracy that is..
Comment 509.3	You&#39;ve  got Scotland and Ireland who voted remain and Wales and England voted out.  so what&#39;s the right decision?
Comment 509.4	zzzzzsleeping well actually the brexit vote wasnt actually legally binding, it was more of like how do u guys think of leaving The EU?
Comment510	Commie Corbyn has wanted a damn general election every time someone sneezes then Boris said ok have one then he and all the others put their tails between their legs and said no...
Comment 510.1	@MaxSpender again Corbyn wanted one every week for years... even a week and two before he was offered one hell a handful of days before he said the same thing he was then given what he wanted then says yeah no, he knows there will be a power shift causing his party to lose alot of seats as shown in polls, he is nothing but a liar and coward, we is doing nothing but trying to stop what was voted on same with alot of MPs who are nothing but Europhiles who refuse to go throw with the will of the people, also the fact more people now than ever just want it to be done and over with this also feeds into the massive drop in support labour has.
Comment 510.2	@MrTrainerGuy1 Corbyn will be only too happy to have General Election after 31st October, once an extension&#39;s been agreed. But will Boris be so keen then? We&#39;ll see...
Comment 510.3	He wanted one like a week or two before Boris offered him one then the one time he was given one he turns it down, also the reason he turned it down wasn&#39;t because of what you said its because the labour polls show how little support they have now it has dropped while the Tory one has gone up, they don&#39;t want a vote because it would shuffle power around and they most likely would have a hard time trying to block anything, These people are cowards and traitor&#39;s refusing to do anything to bring about what was voted for they are fifth columnist
Comment 510.4	MrTrainerGuy1 Holding a General Election now would close parliament &amp; allow Boris to force through No Deal on 31st October. The opposition aren’t aren’t going to fall into any little Tory traps.
Comment 510.5	Who voted for Boris? Who voted for May? One&#39;s lost in the Forest and she has nothing to say.

That old historically German origin the Royal House of von Hannover Saxe - Coburg und Gotha (Windsor) Queen, Elizabeth II, is the most impressive and valuable crown jewel of the UK. She is a real national treasure.
Comment 517.1	She&#39;s also a direct descendent of Genghis Khan (via the now extinct Russian Royal Family) and of the Prophet Mohammed (via the Arab Kings of Medieval Spain) and of the brother of Vlad the Impaler - later fictionalised as Count Dracula. She has quite a complex bloodline ...

Comment 522.1	@Thomas Reedy So it is! I thought it was just a member of the commonwealth. But it stands that it is recognised as an independent nation. The Queen may be the &quot;figure head&quot; but Canada is separate and outside of British government.
Comment 522.2	@Lil&#39; Ulrich Whats that?
Comment 522.3	@Alex <br /><br />Um ... Canada is a member state of the United Kingdom.  It doesn&#39;t have a president.  The Queen the head of state and is on the money.<br /><br />The British parliament has no power over the Canadian parliament.
Comment 522.4	First off Canada is a presidential system. Second off, do you want another revolution? Because that is how you get a revolution.

Comment 536.1	@Mohamed Burhan Exactly.
Comment 536.2	@Antiquus Custos The world economy as it set up now uses the US dollar. Not a bad thing unless you cross the US which can use the dollar against you.<br />Unless a new reserve currency is widely adopted it is going to be the case.<br />It is not a problem facing India alone even Europe.
Comment 536.3	@Mohamed Burhan You are correct in saying that India wants to trade with many countries across the globe to promote prosperity and stability. But the problem it is facing is the widening gap (just as we have in Europe and North America) between very wealthy and poor people. In simple words, rich become richer on a daily basis, whilst common poor people hardly face any economic growth upon their lives. It is definitely not fully dependent on the US in any way but its economy is managed via USD in most cases and its loans are taken from the US banks. This should not necessarily be bad but it ties it more with the US.
Comment 536.4	@Antiquus Custos was replying to someone who was looking down on India.<br />Also India works also Russia even buys weapons and co develops with them.<br />I don&#39;t think is dependent on USA it is a country that works with its allies if there is a benefit to be gained

Comment 543.3	@E. R. No, I am not. Mature are those who were fooled but can&#39;t recognize that. And if you show them the true they revolt against you not against those who fooled them. Because you know stupid people don&#39;t like when we show them how stupid they are. It is easier to be angry than admit you are stupid.
Comment544	It is, therefore, time for a <b><i>full Brexit:</i></b><br />Scotland voted 62% to <b><i>remain</i></b> in the European Union:<br />Britain, you must leave Scotland by October 31st.<br />Northern Ireland voted 56% to <b><i>remain</i></b> in the European Union:<br />Britain, you must leave Northern Ireland by October 31st.<br />Honour the vote. Respect the mandate of the people!<br />The Queen commands it, now do it.
Comment 544.1	@Fuzzthefurr You elect EU MP&#39;s who then elect the leader of the EU parliament. They are not unelected, please list the &quot;ruling&quot; power they have over countries? No one elected May or Boris.
Comment 544.2	@Swurvin Creations Except Brussels does run everyone in the EU, and has plenty of ruling power even without &#39;government parties&#39;. It&#39;s a self-elected dictatorship.
Comment 544.3	@Jock Duff Just another ploy to reclaim back NI into Ireland.
Comment 544.4	You might want to actually understand the vote before you comment. The Brexit supporters don&#39;t, and it appears this Irishman doesn&#39;t either.
Comment 544.5	2014 says they stayed in the UK.
Comment545	I really feel sorry for the Queen. The last thing she needs at her age is to be used by this Brexit government. Obviously BoJo has no respect for anyone. Not even for the Queen.
Comment 545.1	Oh plz shut the fuck up.
Comment546	GOD SAVE THE QUEEN. GOD SAVE THIS NATION
Comment 546.1	The national anthem dont deserve to be sung at england games
Comment 546.2	She ain&#39;t no human being ..........
Comment 546.3	You got the second line wrong. <br />It&#39;s: we mean it man.... There is no future in England&#39;s dreaming.
Comment 546.4	There is no god.
Comment 546.5	Indeed!
Comment547	She wants out.... 👍
Comment 547.1	"@Gao Li So do you think that when every politician in the global world stands up and say very clearly that they are working towards a New World Order that it&#39;s just us being conspiracy theorists ?<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7jtI6O1Ido"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7jtI6O1Ido</a>        <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MADYzQstpsU</a>     <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYa2xJ-Xy8w"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYa2xJ-Xy8w</a>"
Comment 547.2	@Angel of Justice Maybe don&#39;t speak on behalf of the queen of England, do you even know her? <br /><br />I also don&#39;t think that every criticism of the EU is ridiculous, but your ideas aren&#39;t based on reality. You&#39;re talking about &quot;globalists&quot; and other crazy conspiracy theories.<br /><br />Also, despite its flaws, I consider the EU and European cooperation overall to be a good thing. Life in Europe has been more peaceful than it has ever been in the existence of the entire continent.
Comment 547.3	@Gao Li did not vote Brexit because I don&#39;t live in the UK idiot I live in France under EU rule and my country&#39;s democracy has been destroyed thanks to the EU globalist scum! As for the Queen wanting to protect her future, I would find it most probable that she wants out of the EU too!   You speak as if all those who would want to free themselves from the undemocratic EU are stupid! The only idiots are the ones who can not see the European Parlement push for a one-world government! As for France unemployment is the highest it&#39;s ever been and taxes are destroying french businesses! I don&#39;t believe in conspiracy theories? I believe in critical thinking! The EU has made it very clear the power that they are searching for and there is no doubt in my mind that they are working hard towards taking out all probable opposition!
Comment 547.4	@Angel of Justice Because you cannot distinguish between satire and reality? Did you vote for Brexit because you believe in conspiracy theories?
Comment 547.5	@Gao Li well it wont matter soon if brexit happens ! But if i does not we will talk about this in 10 years time !
Comment548	All that wealth is disgusting in a world with starving children.
Comment 548.1	@sir Beanalot ...go back to sleep, typical.
Comment 548.2	@Justice Warrior You forgot Jesus Christ was Black LMFBO SIMPLETONS EVERYWHERE, IQ of a Gnat!
Comment 548.3	@Swurvin Creations He changed his comment from negative toward the UK to positive toward it.
Comment 548.4	@General Ripper You can thank Scotland for half or more of those inventions.
Comment549	Fuck the British government but not the people but fuck the British people who deserve to be fucked
Comment550	She actually looks like my grandma. What if she&#39;s a fake and my grandma is the real queen? Man i would treat all of you a $999 apple stand.
