Comment6	Your queen has spoken brits,now bow
Comment7	Great Britain should be renamed as Great Bandit.
Comment8	Give us the kohinoor you thieves.
Comment9	To Americans, this is like sort of like your &quot;State of the Union&quot; speech except the Queen is not elected like your officials are and we dress up like Harry Potter characters.
Comment10	I really love her sound it&#39;s could make me feel relaxing when I not :)
Comment11	you know the old windbags lying her lips is moving
Comment12	It is time to go dear queen
Comment13	Wow she looks so evil.
Comment14	My government my government my government
Comment15	If you look closely Johnson is playing with the small change in his pocket.
Comment16	Why other english people don&#39;t speak like this, crystal clearly. 😀
Comment17	The blessings of Almighty God do not include robbing people of their money due to phony Climate Change.
Comment 17.1	anthropogenic climate change denial should be made a crime against humanity. Troll off with your fake views.
Comment18	&quot;....ending free movement...&quot; does this enigmatic sentence mean that &#39;free movement&#39; of EU citizens will be abolished?  There are living 2,9 million EU citizens in UK of which 2,15 million are working whereas there are 1,2 million  UK citizens living in EU countires of which are mostly retired people.. Well,  will then then all those retired UK people and other Brits owning houses in &#39;warmer&#39; European countries like Portunal, Spain, France, Italy, Greece etc. will have to have to face also  limitations of their &#39;free movement&#39; also? Well, I hope not, otherwise my French Haut-Médoc will turn into Guinness Ale. Other promises of Mr. Johnson sound quite promising which I could easily go along. However, I have the impression that the poor Queen was a bit exhausted after such a long speech. As shes reigns since 1952 the &#39;United Kingdom&#39; and since she is the second Queen after Elisabeth I on the British throne, I suggest that the term &#39;United Kingdom&#39; should finally be changed into &#39;United Queendom&#39;.
Comment19	What about protecting English European ethnic people and culture from globalist garbage and making London, London again?🤔
Comment 19.1	@Public Public Does not matter at this point
Comment 19.2	Was that before or after the Romans?
Comment20	She could have simply sold those ‘taxpayer’ jewels and given Dom and Boris the sum they shorted off the British economy so they could buy their mega yachts and keep their financial plays between themselves . That would have saved us citizens from the horror and crime of brexit and the vast losses which will represent SO much more than that , in perpetuity.
Comment 20.1	Or we can just catch all those who plotted to crash the pound and put their heads on spikes over Traitors Gate.
Comment21	Lies, lies and more lies....yawn. They have an agenda to follow , full control of our freedom, movement and privacy.more ways to tax us, more ways to deceive us .
Comment 21.1	brexit was funded to crash the pound.
Comment22	If I am 93 and can still make myself a sandwich, that would be an achievement...The Queen is amazing
Comment23	Who maintains those wigs? Does everyone take care of their own wigs? This British government system is quite fascinating!🤔🤔
Comment24	What an excellent speech and every thing I want for my Country and Her Majesty stating this is about Great Britain  I am a Brexiteer for one reason that is to be Governed by  Great Britain and not  living  under a dictatorship from  the European union  that is falling apart at the seams  . .

Comment35	Now watch Scotland leave the UK and join the EU... PM was warned of that too. I can see this being a possible train wreck. I do hope its not a train wreck. We shall see.
Comment36	Any monarch in a democratic nation has a moral obligation to end their monarchy forever.
Comment37	I would prefer to hear her say &quot;our government&quot;.

Comment50	You dont blow or suck you malingerererrr.
Comment51	"Don&#39;t expect any of it to be honoured friends. It&#39;s just a sales pitch. A lot of it is just general &quot;woolly&quot; statement that are unquantifiable drivel. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=5m50s"">5:50</a> &quot;my Government will take steps to make work fairer, introducing measures that will support those working hard.&quot; It sounds nice but means f**k all. You can take the whole speech and if you break it down most of it would not stand a test of whether it was a Smart goal - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound. Indeed, if he cut out the froth she could probably have been done in a third of the time."
Comment52	still strong as iron.<br />better and stronger than all the parliment and borris johnson<br />she knows how to handle things from front and from behind the viels.
Comment53	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=6m39s"">6:39</a> How awesome would it have been if she had paused after reading &quot;...accelerate the delivery of fast reliable and secure Broadband networks&quot; and said: &quot;these are just words to me, I have no idea what I just read&quot; :D :D"

Comment59	Long live the Queen and God bless king and Queen 🙏🏻
Comment60	The glory of British tradition. What lost soul must one be to dismiss this, our heritage of a thousand years?
Comment61	Da stupid queen
Comment62	By the way when is the Queen returning the Kohinoor Diamond that was stolen from India ? May be that will make her crown look ugly but still you cannot retain something which is not your&#39;s.
Comment63	There are many large DIAMONDs
Comment64	Are we really in 2019? Is it not time to remove this BS from our hearts and minds. I am speaking of this pomp and garbage (this decor is all glamor, insincerity, glitter, power over through show of wealth etc.).<br /><br />We all know real history of British Empire. <br /><br />Maybe the queen should sell all of that gold, silver, glorification of the material over what really matters— unity in action, love, equality. She could return that money to the areas of the world her family and UK plundered.<br /><br />I personally do not know enough to comment on the content of her speech.<br /><br />I do know enough to know this pomp is outdated. It is ridiculous.<br /><br />The changes made she reads are in an important positive direction, yes.
Comment65	Weird traditions and weird outdated rituals. Anyone else seeing this shitshow.
Comment66	Uh ... while I&#39;m on the subject. Guess who the new (REAL) queen is going to be..........(hint) She LOVED her subjects !
Comment67	Uh....sorry to break the news to you guys......the queen is DEAD DEAD DEAD ! That old hag you are looking at is a CLONE ! Have a nice day.

Comment69	a hereditary monarchy whos instructing an unelected prime-minister who was put into place by a party who lost the vote. brilliant!
Comment 69.1	Other way round. The prime minster writes the speech, the queen just reads it
Comment70	bla bla bla bla
Comment71	let&#39;s get the hell out of the EU now what the people voted for &amp; that is that.
Comment 71.1	@plantgirlI voted under how I have felt for over 10 years thank you! please don&#39;t presume to tell me how I or others voted! it just remain propaganda.
Comment 71.2	Uncle Buck you didn’t vote fairly, you voted under the influence of ignorance, provided to you by Cambridge Analytica, Facebook and some guys who you just made a lot of money for. Well done!
Comment72	The diamonds on that old lizards head, neck and robes could feed a COUNTRY!! Definition of a circle jerk?........parliament!<br />Makes me sick. Billions of euros for pomp and ceremonies and the old hag doesnt do shit but read.
Comment 72.1	Ok so you’ve sold all of the diamonds and then in 10 year’s you’re short of cash. What do you do?
Comment73	Will Johnson&#39;s head be on the £50 coin or a spike over Traitors Gate ?

GOD ALMIGHTY SAID UK SHOULD REMAIN IN EUROPEAN UNION. ( AN AN MOUTH SPEAK OF OUR LORD GOD ALMIGHTY WHO IS HEAVEN JEREMIAH 1:5-19 ) SHALOM SHALOM SHALOM AMEN.
Comment84	Lovely Lady. Time to make this roadshow needs to wind down.  Shut the castle&#39;s down sell all the assets, give her a commoners pension off they all go. No lol
Comment85	Bomb attacks in hong kong, protesters beat dissidents. This is Hong Kong. For your own safety, please do not go to Hong Kong. Hong kong is as dangerous as afghanistan, full of terrorist attacks.
Comment86	I like her golden mic
Comment87	I am against Brexit but I am for all the reasons mentioned here. EU should reconsider it&#39;s identity and politics. I hope we don&#39;t &quot;re-activate the time machine&quot; and force UK to clean the left crap that is poisoning Europe again (!!!) And sadly I am not talking about those arguably potentially good political and economical left messures, I am talking about cultural ignorance
Comment88	As an east-europeean I have to say that I hope that is goong to happen the way The Queen mentioned in the speech. If that will turn out that way, GB has a chance to re-ignite a light in what europeean culture used to be and is now dying
Comment89	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=0m00s"">0:00</a> - <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=1m08s"">1:08</a> - I wonder how many people in London got stabbed."
Comment90	Okay please get on with the environmental and animal laws. Like forgot about brexit thats what we really need right now!!
Comment91	If that is gonna happen, UK will be great again
Comment92	Long live the queen!
Comment93	a sheaksperean comedy over and over and over again.... congratulations your majesty!!!! with much mockery as usual. the third act is over..the curtain will rise..the masks will fall..plug on!!! You will pay in the fire of hell ypur lizard demon for every single child you ate and for every blood you drink..good trip to the hell GAME OVER
Comment94	Britain keeps the Royal family because they want to feel special.
Comment95	Bravo. From her lips to God&#39;s ears.
Comment96	祝女王健康长寿!
Comment97	I bet the queen isn&#39;t best amused by the prospect of being once again made a potential target for attack by Irish republicans, lol. She&#39;s probably thinking OMG, WTF is that fool Boris &#39;non-sense&#39; Johnson attempting to do! Whilst the British government sets up soldier &#39;F&#39; as a fall guy for it&#39;s political miscalculations in assuming that they could have found a solution and prevent total civil war from breaking out in Belfast.
Comment98	Anachronistic fish out of Water.
Comment99	God bless Her Majesty!! Long live the Queen. ❤️

Comment106	Queen dripping some ice👸🏼
Comment107	Seriously, look how outdated this is, That speech was full of nothing, nothing was said of importance, I&#39;m looking forward to the 31st, Let&#39;s see what happens boys
Comment108	Why can’t she write her own speech lol I’ve noticed that all the of the Queen’s speeches in the past few years have had input from The Government
Comment 108.1	@NoYourself Yes you&#39;re right
Comment 108.2	All queens speeches at the opening of parliament are 100% written by the government. They are just a list of the governments plans for the next year. Remember the queen doesn’t have any input over what laws are passed.
Comment109	Did you notice she wasn&#39;t wearing the correct crown.See Monday 13th Oct UK Column news on YouTube.
Comment110	support Scottish independence!! Long live William Wallace!!!!
Comment 110.1	I supported Scottish independence in 2014, my family was going to come back from exile, but Scotland voted to stay in the UK. Far as I’m concerned, it’s just empty words now. Scotland had its chance, and blew it.
Comment111	The real King of England was in Australia, look it up

Comment119	Yeah that&#39;s her own moral anchor, not alot of people agree with what laws people in the parliament make out...
Comment120	So sad for the UK. What an awful P.M. and Brexit situation.
Comment121	Not enough domestically trained medical professionals to fill all the positions about to be vacated by EU medical professionals... but sure, UK academia will find a way to lead the world in science. Totally believable goals...
Comment122	Rappers: do fuck all and get respect and live rich lives.<br />Monarch,: do charitable things and invest in such, and keep the peace, bring in tourism ect. <br /><br /><br />Then u get those morons claiming to be poor saying the monarch should be abolished, for some reason. They poor lol and spend £100 on a hoodie at Footasylum, and look at all those subscriptions they pay for, dressing like a posh chav. pathetic. hypocritical. Straight out of Compton, more like straight out of Compton in Cornwall. Don&#39;t give power to those people please. Labour is owned by Unions nowadays.
Comment123	BBC are so triggered by the Queens speech 😂
Comment124	Seems like honor is dead in parliment, the can hardly keep themselves quiet the morons, let alone look at the queen with proper respect and listening properly
Comment125	Since prime ministers always write the Queen&#39;s opening of parliament speech, it&#39;s no wonder that Boris was puffed out like an enormous toad.
Comment126	It was nice to hear the words of Good Queen Bess II. She has an elegance rarely heard. The LORD chose wisely. And without her presence this day, Brexit would not succeed.
Comment127	At the porters desk opposite the elevator, he normally keeps a stock of
Comment128	To clear up for the general public who are clueless: This entire speech is written by the government. Whatever your opinions are, this is a tory speech, made specifically to fit the tory narrative.
Comment129	🇪🇺 Love to see Her Majesty in great health. Respect and greetings 😊

Comment132	Children in costume pretending to matter
Comment133	Where are the Terrorists?
Comment134	A time travel.
Comment135	Horrifying:  all of it.    and that frightening child Bobbing on his seat Boris Johnson takes the cake..  Dynastic Monarchy seems incompatible with 21st century sentient humanity.   The French citizens got it right so many centuries ago.
Comment136	Monarchy in the UK (in the era of such massive austerity measures, the nation has been suffering from) has never been that irrelevant, a sick joke indeed!
Comment137	Bunch of pompous basterds
Comment138	Long live the Queen and long live The United Kingdom 😎 with love from a stubborn Canadian loyalist.
Comment139	live 4ever mama. wel wishes frm your former loyal colony-the republic of kenya in africa.4ever we shal b ua loyal former subjects my lady.
Comment140	The real welfare recipients right here.
Comment141	Note how the Queen says &quot;MY government&quot;.  It&#39;s NOT the people&#39;s government.  The MPs pledge allegiance to the QUEEN, not to the people.  That&#39;s why parliament does what it wants and not what the PEOPLE wants.  Time to wake up people!  Drain the swamp!  Take over parliament and kick out the traitors!
Comment142	Yes make the United Kingdom great again

Comment146	<b>The amount of money she&#39;s wearing in jewelry, cost more than every rap video, that ever existed combine, and it&#39;s still worth more than every rapper jewelry ever worn and bought combine, that crown is probably worth hundreds of millions, and over a billion if it&#39;s for sale, just because of who currently owns it.</b>
Comment147	seriously how the hell can they sit there preaching crap, &amp; knowing the destroyed &amp; killed countless countries of people to wear the diamonds all on the blood of innocent. she is actually say nothing except that they will take more freedoms from you, the stupid, which is how they see you!
Comment148	I chose my Queen over the EU anyday.
Comment 148.1	royalists are always &quot;So&quot; Star Stuck.    horrifying.
Comment149	Pedovore, thief, not in any way any more elite than the next person.
Comment150	Несколько лет тому назад говорили,что Греция выходит из Евросоюза, а получилось Великобритания покидает Евросоюз.
Comment151	DID SHE SAY  &quot;GLOBAL IMMIGRATION SYSTEM?&quot;  so is she admitting that GB is responsible for the arabs in france, Germany and Switzerland raping whites? I hope  DIANAS murdered ghost reaches up and .........................................

Comment155	Face it BBC, Brexit is the will of the people!
Comment156	Those wigs are the shit
Comment157	When my Queen is around you MPS are so well behaved. But when she&#39;s at the palace they behaved so badly.. Very refreshing to see Boris and Corbyn at their best behavior.🤔
Comment158	The education system will assure that you are well prepared to be a good sheep em worker.
Comment159	Someone get that lady some &#39;Thug life&#39; sunglasses! Hand a pair to Boris as well and get him a Churchill cigar as to blow smoke in the faces of laborloons.<br /><br />Let me translate that speech into American english for ya. <b>ahem</b><br /><br />Sit down and STFU you bloody snowflake remoaners!

Comment163	Are u gonna lock urself up for taking organs etc sick
Comment164	Bye bye Bobby.... Police Regime
Comment165	Hahahahahaha
Comment166	I wish u all get organ failure
Comment167	Isn&#39;t she like 129
Comment168	Judging by the Jewels dangling about her the Queen governs with a karat-and-stick approach!
Comment169	John Bercow could have donned a wig for one speech.<br /><br />As a side note I would love to know what the Queen thought of the speech?   Did she agree with some, most, all?  Or did she find it to be a bunch of rubbish?  🤔
Comment170	Thank God.

Comment175	Wow!  A terrific speach.  God bless the Queen Eluzabeth.  She&#39;s in charge!
Comment 175.1	Now see Mondays UK Column news .You and the rest of us are being decieved.
Comment176	One of the things I remember about my departed grandmother, was how much respect and admiration she had for Her Majesty. Over the last four decades, I’ve seen various specials and speeches, and I’ve grown to respect Her myself. It made me grin when I found out that Her Majesty and I actually have something in common, militarily. I understand that, as a young princess, She did Her part in the war in the motor pool as a driver. Some few years later, I did my own part as a US Marine, in the motor pool as a driver. lol <br /><br />Cheers, you lot, from Boston.
Comment177	Imagine if someone farted in there 😩😂
Comment178	I wanted to hear a queen&#39;s speech: her words, not Boris&#39;
Comment 178.1	She agrees wholeheartedly and started out saying they will Brexit.
Comment179	God save  our queen  Elizabeth I I for  ever:):):)
Comment180	She is a evil witch! <br /><br />She is profiting from theft, kidnapping, rape, and murder (another way of saying slavery and colonialism). Hundreds of millions of people died so that she can wear her stolen jewelry.
Comment181	Am I missing something here?, She&#39;s an old woman reading a speech that she didn&#39;t write to a government she doesn&#39;t have an ounce of control over. Like in total honesty, what exactly does this achieve? We need solid change, not a 90 something year old woman with shiny headgear telling us to all get along.
Comment 181.1	Do some research. She can kick all their asses out of parlaiment if she chooses. She IS the final word and the law. She is the most powerful woman in the world.
Comment 181.2	This old women has done more in her life than you  ever will god save are queen.
Comment182	The British Halloween party also called <br /> The pompous pumpkin . Or pissing away of taxpayers money.

Comment 185.4	@Arran Vid boris is the parrot
Comment 185.5	She doesn’t want Brexit, she was once wearing a EU themed outfit. She’s just parroting whatever Boris wrote in the speech for her
Comment186	&quot;MY GOVERNMENT WILL ENSURE THAT MY PEDOPHILE, SEX SCANDAL RIDDEN SON, ANDREW WILL CO-OPERATE WITH AUTHORITIES,  AND MYSELF AND PRINCE PHILLIP WILL STEP DOWN BECAUSE OF OUR BLOOD DRINKING AND CHILD CHOMPING SINS&quot;

Comment213	So..... basically they want everything the EU has to offer except for free movement and paying their fair share, like everyone else. The rest of it is bullshit and has nothing to do with being in the EU. <br />Boris is smiling because he can’t believe he actually got the queen to believe his school boy lies and repeat them.

Respect the mandate of the people!<br />The Queen commands it, now do it.

Comment237	God save the queen.
Comment238	So the Queen is now going against the will of the majority of her now better informed people who were duped into this vote by greedy Tories.   Perhaps  QE2 is looking to fill her own pockets via Brexit.  It is 2019, how much longer can the monarchy really last?
Comment239	🙌🇺🇸
Comment 239.1	What does even mean?
Comment240	The fact these British jackasses still have a monarchy that owns more land (6.6 billion acres) than god is really amazing. Bunch of sheep...
Comment 240.1	@Chris Gray Fair few mate, we have conquered more of the world than any other nation to exist. But I think you&#39;ll find this all happened a long time ago, and Queen Liz isn&#39;t really responsible for what her ancestors decided to conquer. We also are no longer in control of about 75% of the countries, hence all the issues in Hong Kong currently. Gone from a british way of life, to a commuinst chinese way of life. I do not condone any of this crap, just like I dont condone our great nations invading the gulf for nothing but money. Answered your question?
Comment 240.2	​@JR 7 That&#39;s all you got for a comeback. You made an argument that made no sense whatsoever to my comment, apples, and oranges so to speak. Then my reply was not answered at all. So, again I will ask. How many people died to acquire all that land that your queen owns?

Comment250	So many morons on this comment section who have no idea how a constitutional monarchy actually works. Stop embarrassing yourselves...
Comment251	8 minutes in I thought she&#39;d fall asleep
Comment 251.1	Ruediger Preiss Lol
Comment252	All the Queens speech contains are government tasks which could be taken at any time. Introducing them using gradual steps, which can always be used as benchmarks to guide implementation as well as making changes when necessary are missing from the concept. The important point is to have a clear plan in which important goals are set for a period of years so that every year there is an opportunity to make progress on a number of fronts,  with progress based on high quality low tech programs to add balance in years of low revenues. <br /><br />It is manifestly obvious this concept of yearly progress, regardless of the scarcity of revenues, has not occurred to the Conservatives at all. Why? <br /><br />The absence of  practical methods to maintain progress over the past few years is a notable shortcoming and does not bode well for future achievement.
Comment253	Queen isn&#39;t Queen without Freddie Mercury. Who <b>is</b> that woman?
Comment 253.1	Freddie didn&#39;t go anyway. In which instance are you?
Comment254	Most of the comments here are what you would expect of The Rabble (aka the socially inferior or uncouth people).

Comment261	Didn&#39;t hear anything about tackling one of the biggest failures of the uk: homelessness
Comment 261.1	@@tiabiamama <br /><br />That&#39;s insulting to the vast majority of immigrants living and working here in the UK who are hard working and contribute to the UK economy.  The talk of EU immigrants here just to get free benefits and healthcare as though there is a large majority of them doing so is pathetic right wing media nonsense which has sadly influenced far too many of their readers.   If an EU citizen has moved here to the UK but not found enployment here within 3 months of arriving, they have to move back to the continent, or at least they&#39;re supposed to anyway.  That&#39;s not the EU&#39;s fault if we haven&#39;t been dealing with it properly.<br /><br />Hope the Letwin amemdment passes before the vote on Johnson&#39;s deal.takes place.  If it gets to the vote and the majority vote down Johnson&#39;s deal, that doesn&#39;t mean that that majority support No Deal.  Johnson.better not pull off that stunt by taking it as a No Deal majority in the Commons because if the majority are against his deal, the majority will be against No Deal as well.
Comment 261.2	Oh no. She said they will allow PRODUCTIVE people who have immigrated to stay. Getting rid of the unproductive and the criminals will allow more brits to take advantage of their existing social services, instead of pandering to the globalist dream of foisting third world joyriders onto the UK social services system.
Comment 261.3	@Teresa Belshaw it included social care reform.
Comment 261.4	or poverty
Comment 261.5	They already did that. Be better informed and check out the proposals.
Comment262	British version of Cirque du Soleil.
Comment263	There wouldn’t have been any need to put the queen under this kind of stress if the politicians had not been disgustingly lying and playing dirty games. Now they want the queen to save their asses. Don’t tell me the queen at 85, knows what a broad band means. I respect the queen and would urge British to respect themselves please.
Comment264	So the Conservatives have been in power for nine years and have imposed austerity on the nation and not much else while Labour stood around without much comment. Now they propose all of these ambitions and I think it&#39;s too late. I really don&#39;t know who these people represent and that goes for both parties.
Comment265	I guess that settles it, its not the peoples government after all...

Comment271	Syria on verge of calling in Russia to defend the north from the Turkish invasion and this crap is still being put up by BBC?

Comment287	The queen of England is of German descent. Very interesting.
Comment 287.1	Also through the female line she descents from the British kings from the middle ages.
Comment 287.2	All European royal families originate from another country than the one they rule.
Comment 287.3	She is a descendant of prophet mohamed.
Comment 287.4	Direct descendant of British royalty. They all intermarried each other. Even the Russian monarchs were of British and German descent.
Comment288	The bloke sitting next to the queen has a brother whos been taped shagging kids, his dad is also on FBI list for kiddy crimes!
Comment 288.1	@Public Public its on video, CNN has broadcasted it. You can watch &quot;The Prince and the Paedophile&quot; on Channel 4 today (21/10/19) for more evidence (although expect it to be heavily watered down, not many convictions in the Epstein scandal yet, just a few deaths)
Comment 288.2	evidence?
Comment 288.3	Well she did say historic crimes will be addressed.i am hoping queenie will give her sons the boot and give the crown to willes and kate.send the child molesters to antartica frozen gulag.castrated and disowned.

Comment291	The Queen is amazing!
Comment 291.1	Amazing my arse, just an old woman
Comment 291.2	She is the amazing grace.look at her face
Comment292	Can someone from Great Britain enlighten an ignorant American? What is the purpose of carrying out the crown ahead of the Queen? Is it because there is no current King in the line of succession until the Queen passes away?
Comment 292.1	@NoYourself Aaah yes, that makes more sense. I guess I should have thought about it more I would have realized that. I completely forgot hes the next in line.
Comment 292.2	Andrew Nyberg Because he won’t become king until his mother (the queen) dies. The UK can’t have a queen who is queen in her own right and a king at the same time.
Comment 292.3	@Bill Gowland Isnt that the Kings Crown though? Shes wearing hers.
Comment 292.4	Basically its to heavy for her at her age <br />Plus the fact she&#39;s a life long lazy bugger

Comment302	The smile on boris’ face says it all
Comment 302.1	Perhaps the grin was on account of his vibrating butt plug ?
Comment 302.2	The Queen is most likely livid with Johnson since his governemnt is the biggest threat to UK sovereignty in hundreds of years and likely to cause civil war.<br />The smile on Johnson&#39;s face says all those who have money riding on brexit crashing the pound will be hearing what they want to hear because brexit was funded to crash the pound.
Comment 302.3	Arran Vid yeah I get that

Comment313	Just one long shopping list, no substance whatsoever
Comment314	I bet she wanted to smack all their heads together and sack the lot of them for failing her people.
Comment315	She has more value on her head than 10 working men would make in a lifetime. All stolen.

Comment317	...yawn...no spirit...
Comment318	who is that now??? damn this brexit thing is confusing...
Comment319	So, this is what the Queen has become.. A mouthpiece for Rees-Mogg and Johnson writing. Truly sad!
Comment 319.1	The queen remains as neutral as possible and tries to say out of politics. Also known as she reads whatever the current pm gives her
Comment320	I smell bacon
Comment321	She didn&#39;t write this. She&#39;s only reading word for word what was handed to her by Boris Johnson.
Comment 321.1	Yes but how eloquently  read we British have such class and Her Majesty the Queen is our Sovereign ruler she is above the Government and all around her need to remember she is the only one who can abolish the Government if they go against our wishes on the 31st of October .
Comment 321.2	@Bill Gowland I fully agree with you! It&#39;s definitely a PR stunt more than anything of substance.
Comment 321.3	@Niaaal the speech was about what Boris and his government are proposing to do over the length of his new Parliament <br />Now there&#39;s smoke and mirrors and there&#39;s blowing smoke up peoples arses <br />To me that speech was the later <br />All the proposals are just pie in the sky <br />Designed to win votes in the coming general election
Comment 321.4	@Bill Gowland What are you saying? That Brexit won&#39;t happen? I&#39;m pro Europe myself, but I can&#39;t read where you stand
Comment 321.5	@Niaaal <br />Fairy tale <br />Tall tale <br />Shaggy dog story <br />Take your pick <br />It ain&#39;t going to happen
Comment322	This is so scripted why doesn&#39;t she not just speak her mind to people
Comment 322.1	stuart dan the Queen is supposed to be above politics so you will never hear her comment on any political matters. She has also come to realise that people will support the monarchy more if she has an air on mystery about her so she almost never gives her opinion about anything.
Comment323	You Brits are lucky. Would you like to trade her for Trump?
Comment 323.1	chickenman226 lol
Comment 323.2	@Stuart oliver gobble
Comment 323.3	chickenman226 wow what an insult hahahaaaaaaa ok chicken boy 😂😂😂😂
Comment 323.4	@Stuart oliver shut it fish boy...
Comment 323.5	Yes
Comment324	So the queen is just a mouthpiece for whatever the current government gives her to read? Rather overpaid. I bet there are better readers than a lifelong horse racing addict that doesn&#39;t read books.
Comment325	Plunderers of India.
Comment 325.1	@J M speaks of your volumes. Won&#39;t get down to your level. But that&#39;s the fact, you survived on indian resources in WW2. 45 trillion, u phonetic.

Comment 329.1	@Bill Gowland   Ha ha!  I hadn&#39;t thought of that!  Oh my, but his speech was just drivel, utter drivel.  He&#39;s typical elite/global cabal.  He&#39;s not going to deliver the UK out of the EU - never going to happen.  The extension will take place and then it will give them time to create more chaos.  There will be so much chaos that &#39;something must be done&#39;.

Comment 337.1	You’re right Magenta but they should rename themselves Saxe-Coburg Gotha
Comment 337.2	Since women back in the day couldn&#39;t carry on the name of the family, the name was Saxe-Coburg &amp; Gotha, however through the female line she descents from the English kings from the middle ages. Since they didn&#39;t want to have anything to do with Germany in WWI they abolished all German titles and names, and therefore renamed themselves House of Windsor, so they could be 100% British.
Comment338	Friendly cooperation? Nothings gonna change. Smoke and mirrors.

Comment346	The audience is packed in like sardines. If there was a fire or a terrorist attack, they would all be found in their seats...
Comment 346.1	True , but you&#39;d think they&#39;d have the most security possible for events as such.
Comment347	So it&#39;s a GB No Deal on October 31st to turn into a whole of the UK No Deal shortly afterwards after a short extension then as he won&#39;t sign the withdrawal agreement because signing it would destroy his hopes of a trade deal with Trump. That&#39;s if it gets that far.<br /><br />And he&#39;s going to ignore the Benn act no matter what.  He ought to get be criminal record for breaking the law by failing to go to Brussels with the extension request letter if we leave thr EU with a destructive No Deal and we suffer several decades more of cripplihg austerity while at the dame time the super rich have become much richer still.

Comment360	My Government are a bunch of criminals and will be Judged .
Comment 360.1	@Leslie Dodds Yes, that&#39;s essentially what I said ... and if they DO NOT report to her every week then what do you imagine would happen ?<br />Absolutely nothing ...
Comment 360.2	@Kit Carr NO your wrong they must report to her weekly she should not dictate what Government decides so if the GOvernment invades other countrys she agrees with it ;;the burdons are making the poor make the rich as was the children of egypt making brick for pharoah slave labour indeed .
Comment 360.3	@Leslie Dodds Sorry, I don&#39;t see where you&#39;re coming from with that comment and I can&#39;t find &#39;burdons&#39; in any dictionary or thesaurus!<br />For clarity - I was suggesting that her government and it&#39;s party members (plus a good number of tories who infiltrated the Labour Party, and a good number of Labour members too will be queueing for hell. HM may or may not - reality is that it&#39;s &#39;only a title&#39;  ( and has been for hundreds of years ) which she gets to keep in return for doing as she is told ...
Comment 360.4	@Kit Carr When the queen says my government it is because its her government these are the kings queens that have always ruled the burdons of egypt have never gone away .

Comment 365.1	The queen does not govern, the government governs. This ceremony is usually performed once per year and the queen reads a speech written by the government explaining what the government wants to achieve for the next year.
Comment 365.2	The Queen reads the government. The speech is written by them. She does not express her personal view.
Comment366	I&#39;m American, the fact that the Queen has spoken this way is a shocker to accept her people have been suffering. God Save the Queen! She Does love her people. 😱😱😱😱

Comment 431.1	Well, that wins the prize for the most irrelevant comment ever. Good grief!
Comment432	Why does the UK still give reverence to a family resulted from the process of imbreeding?
Comment 432.1	Because the monarchy is the head of state. Of not just Britain, but also of Canada. Australia, New Zealand, and many others. Because a constitutional monarchy has resulted in the most free liberal democracies on this planet. And because the United Kingdom, unlike the socialists of Europe, or the rebels of the US, have - can - and will maintain a successful head of state as ordained by God, head of the church, and unifies all subjects of her majesty.
Comment 432.2	We give no reverence to your family.<br /> Read a history book kiddo.

Comment 446.5	You could do better I&#39;m sure, hater.
Comment447	trump, afghanistan and the billions of dollars in the middle east is spent and the money to renew the infrastructure of the United States said twice. There is a deep structure in the United States that trump cannot speak for. He previously instructed the Syrian soldiers to withdraw, but they stalled him again. I think that Trump wants to activate the withdrawal plan using Turkey. Trump american made public and that the horse is trying to consolidate the twet for the 2020 elections and did not control the deep structure that will harm economic aspects in preparation against Turkey gives us. The reason for doing this through the media is to consolidate the American public again and to attract soldiers in the Middle East for American interests. not to fight Kurdish Turkey has entered Syria to destroy the terrorists. Turkish people and Turkish soldiers are always with the oppressed.

Comment463	Sad day when only one of the major parties offers delivering on a democratic result.<br /> All parties should now be leave parties. No question.
Comment 463.1	@Paul Gibbons yes I agree with that!
Comment 463.2	@Tom Goldstein that&#39;s the way the punch and judy show runs.<br /> But what&#39;s important is not ignoring the 2016 referendum.
Comment 463.3	@Paul Gibbons well, half the people. And then we vote again every 5 years for government and it seems to change back and forth between labour and conservative every few years.
Comment 463.4	@Tom Goldstein no... <br /> We would have in independent but conservative future.<br /> An independent but communist future.<br /> Or an independent but Liberal future.<br /> That does not amount to a lack of choice or opposition.<br /> But all three of these opions would be democratic.<br /> The Opposition at the moment is opposing the people, not the government.<br /> Thats just plain wrong.

Comment477	The Queen has so much more power than she uses its time for her to use it to save the UK.
Comment 477.1	@David Clapperton the 5 eyes is the UK so trump and bojo are in syncrony <br />The role of voters in western democracy anticipates years of education  have created a society that knows its power so when.they vote they are the voice ..the failure to free Jillian assange  by UK crowd shows a failure of justice ...so.the supreme  court 11 judges shows justice has also gone astray... In a way jullan assange is more important than brexit.. And the EU has done better than both sides of brexit<br />So bojo can do as he wishes knowing this vote base is his <br />This debate opens many items we take for granted in western democracy that enjoyed colonization ,racialism and even genocide <br />The public has let govt do many evils....in brexit this power is in focus and so because bojo is respecting the vote response . .l agree with him<br />But there is a long journey ahead to stop misuse of power that gave us two big wars and is taking us to the third ...a catastrophe l.must say....trump is proving quite anti war surprisingly .. If the 5 eyes want no war ..there will be no war...the EU is yellow vest France... Stolen vote power
Comment 477.2	@@printmedia14 <br /><br />I see the tories say something on UK TV and radio in relation to brexit that it&#39;s apparently according to the media and tory supporters not legally binding pledge and they do something the complete opposite it&#39;s alright.  Yet apparently a private conversation between Macron and Johnson e.g. that nobody heard on TV or radio and Johnson on what Macron allegedly told he has reported it to the filthy rags what Macron apparently it&#39;s a pledge that&#39;s 100% binding on Macron&#39;s part?<br /><br />Why should I trust what Johnson told the press what Macron, Merkel, Juncker or anyone else apparently told him in private anyway, when he himself fails to stick to a pledge he made on UK TV and radio.
Comment 477.3	@printmedia14 <br /><br />There wasn&#39;t 54% voted Leave.  And none of those ballot papers indicated how they wanted the UK to leave.  They would not have said they wanted a Norway deal, or a May deal, or a Johnson deal or a No Deal or any other way to leave, just a cross in the box voted Leave.  But I can bet that they did not all want exactly the same type of Brexit and they did not know exactly what they were voting for<br /><br />Did any of them when they voted Leave know they were voting to lose their jobs (whose company they work for depends on the UK being in the single market) because we would no longer be in the single market with the intention of staying permanently out of it afterwards, after leaving the EU after the Leave side said during the campaigns we would not be leaving the single market?<br /><br />Did any of them vote for GM crops to be delivered from the USA to the UK to damage the UK&#39;s environment as part of a FTA with Trump when they cast their vote to leave?<br /><br />Did any of them vote for a falling sterling that&#39;s in danger of dropping lower than $1 to the ￡ and lower than €1 to the￡once we leave, when they voted to Leave?<br /><br />Based on the 52% rounded who voted leave it should have went cross party to try to deliver a common brexit that was far more reflective of the result.  But the Tories decided to go it alone and trying to deliver an extreme brexit that&#39;s more reflective of 80% voted Leave.  They did not want parliament to get involved in the whole process, only reporting to Parliament and having to check with Arlene Foster of the DUP if a proposal May made in relation to the Irish border was OK with them begore going ahead with the proposalcafter May missed out on a majority in the 2017 general election.  The government were forced to involve parliament to vote on any proposal or any deal May struck with the EU after losing court case.  Didn&#39;t Johnson claim back in 2016 he wanted parliamentary democracy for Brexit.  Suddenly now he&#39;s Prime Minister he&#39;s been doing everything to bypass parliament even close it down for a prolonged period to suppress debate (also holding up other legislation in the process) to try to deliver the most savage brexit he possibly can at the end of the month.  Only Northern Ireland would escape in this as destructive as no deal withdrawal agreement if it passes, but even then that would likely only be temporary anyway during post brexit trade talks.
Comment 477.4	@David Clapperton the law can be flexible to avoid breaking and yet  reach the goal post...you see the real  issue is in who&#39;s name is  parliament acting...the voters..... If voters ,54% said leave and there were no conditions when the vote was called....so this new law could actually be defiance to the boss.....who is the  VOTER
Comment 477.5	@@printmedia14 <br />.<br />He&#39;s going to hsve to break the law again to achieve No Deal.  No Deal means reneging on the deal for Northern Ireland (if the commons votes in fsvour of his pathetic deal today) which would be after a general election by holding another vote in the commons voting in favour of No Deal if he wins an outright majority.  Reneging on an agreement is law breaking.  Same with him not delivering the extension request letter to Brussels if the commons vote against his deal today would be him breaking the law.  The commons voting against the deal today is not the same thing as them being in favour of No Deal.   Face it, the Leave side have broken the law every step of way to get this far towards No Deal.<br /><br />And then all the sanctions for the UK from the UN come flying in.

Comment482	I’m originally from Nigeria and I wish we never gained independence from the British. We were not ready and could’ve still learned a lot more from them. I don’t buy into all this “colonialism destroyed us” shit. We’ve been independent since 1960 and government after government have only made the situation worse. The British brought education and democracy to our land and we thanked them by kicking them out. I wish they had suppressed every rebellion we put forth ( even though that might’ve made them seem like villains, it would’ve been for the greater good). Just look at how organized and advanced their government is ( constitutional monarchy), not like the decaying kleptocracy that reigns supreme in my country (and by extension, the continent), bleeding us dry.

Comment488	God save the Queen and Her Majesty´s Prime Minister! What comes then to Brexit and the soon coming Halloween 2019, please no more political circus with trick-or-treating there in Westminster, London. The Fourth Reich EU under political, economic and industrial leadership of Germany will anyway take the UK back to be a Western Province of the Reich if the world is too cold and hostile outside the Reich and that your ridiculous identity crisis is over and Britons want to return. Historically the UK fought the WWI and the WWII practically because nothing in Europe (mostly because the UK´s historical outdated Balance of Power -policy in Europe and bully nationalistic pride) and your so called &quot;victories&quot; were historically many ways Pyrrhic in long term. Get finally over it. You have anyway still your historical culture, cultural treasures and the German origin von Hannover Saxe - Coburg und Gotha (Windsor) Royal Family, the Crown Jewels and a lot of old historical bombastic palaces, castles, manors, churches and cathedrals etc. left though the soon after the WWII collapsed British Empire is today only a fading historical memory, &quot;a lost civilization gone with the wind&quot;. Greetings from Northern Europe, from partly arctic Fourth Reich EU Province Finland.

Do you know how that feels this morning? sheer delight.  BORIS YOU HAVE CRACKED IT AND WE LOVE YOU, hope you go down in history.  All those ministerial traitors and those who have lost the wipp should feel so ashamed when our country will boom with financial stability and a economy that a dominates the GLOBAL WORLD. Those traitors hope you never win an MP seat again go and work now for your living preferably in the EU somewhere!!!

Comment493	I have to say:  The Queen of England still looks really good for her age!  However, the shopping list of all good things for Britain will never happen!  She did not talk about her evacuation plans if Brexit goes flip-flop!  I am still looking forward to buying the Queen&#39;s dishes when they hit the auction house!  Why do I think this?  Brexit is going to cost Britain about 15% of its economy which can not support the Royal family!  I am estimating roughly 10 years of financial hardships!  The EU is not going to help Britain when they leave because it will set an example for other members to follow!  Tally ho Britain!  🇨🇦😀
Comment 493.1	@mattes heyne Was fighting Hitler worth the British Empire, a million dead British soldiers, tens of thousands of British civilian lives, and economic ruin? Sometimes the price is worth it.
Comment 493.2	mattes heyne This adventure may not be as fun as you have imagined!  Being laid off 5 times over my work history, every time I was laid off for one week, it took one year to recover, so, when I was laid off for 3 weeks, how long was my financial recovery?  This was not taking into effect a trade disagreements, just market conditions of over supply!  Trust me, being without a job is at the top of my list of the hardest conditions of endurance!  🇨🇦😊
Comment 493.3	AWResistance really? It’s worth the loss of countless jobs? Or the loss of 80% of it’s medical imports? Access to Interpol? Less food and fuel? Funding for universities and schools? Is It really worth all that and more?

Comment 503.1	@DFandV good question. You&#39;d have to ask him. Bear in mind that&#39;s a huge success, landing the chancellor job. It&#39;s not something you&#39;d leave on a whim, cause that would be risky career wise. But then again, a number of Johnson&#39;s ministers have resigned already. It&#39;s possible they might fall out to the point of him leaving, who knows.
Comment 503.2	@Will Berard If he disagrees with Boris Johnson why not stand down from the government.

Comment 510.1	@Tom Webb Were the people who escaped the Titanic &quot;faithless&quot; when they realised the boat was sinking? Nope.<br />Just like myself and everyone else intelligent enough to see our country going down the pan and who also had the means and opportunity to find a future elsewhere.<br />The UK was already a bit of a shithole prior to the 2016 vote, it has got worse since and will continue to deteriorate. <br />As I said, best of luck at those food banks!
Comment 510.2	@Apollo Mead Thanks again for exposing your arrogance, faithlessness and bad attitude to us all.  When an individual such as yourself sinks to such a desperate pathetic low to point out anothers single use of bad grammar/spelling (on a Youtube forum that is littered with millions of irrelevant examples) and then furthermore labels me a cretin and someone whose going to need a food bank without actually having the foggiest clue of who i actually am, then you only serve to reinforce the opinion that others will likely now share with me that we are far far better off without you.  I suspect you are also completely full of $%#! to boot.  Now kindly go and do something positive if you truly have it within you 🙄

Comment 515.3	No she doesn&#39;t.  The cost of the royal family is around £60-70 million per annum, not &quot;billions&quot;.  Also, she works a great many days, or at least she used to when she wasn&#39;t in her nineties!
Comment516	"I&#39;m so moved every time I see your beautiful, majestic Queen. <br />My beloved granny was a lookalike of her, she died in 2012.

I can read it in Her eyes.<br /><br />God save your gracious, noble Queen. From Rome."

Comment520	No, no and no. This conforms to what Tory HQ is <b>brandishing as better?</b> Its entrenching wealth in rural, agricultural and maritime interests alongside voter suppression, fools gold crime legislation*, zero transport plans, zero on homelessness, child poverty, in work poverty or UK born orphans in Syria.  A regressive, undemocratic structural class and racially biased agenda.<br /><br />*Gove is ignored for the sake of spiting Rory Stewart as this will only increase the tally for mayhem, maulings and murder at Her Majesty&#39;s pleasure of the masses caused harm by a state transfixed with privileging the few over the many.  From dodgy court proceedings with culturally inept barristers to rapes and beatings in insecure, frigid gaols over-full with innocents.

Comment522	How many hospitals could be built if those crown jewels were put up for sale my dear?
Comment 522.1	@Joshua Swallow fair enough mate. I consider myself fairly well off. It&#39;s not about taking from the rich and giving to the poor by any means. I am a firm believer that a person creates their own destiny. For 2 reasons though: I feel this kind of ceremony doesn&#39;t reflect the reality for many and is a bit of a puppet show (only my opinion) it&#39;s seems to me, to be out of date and unnecessary). I agree with you on the Pedo aspect though...seems we are surrounded by them). Speaking from the perspective of someone fairly well off...I believe the wealth put into such events such as these could be better utilized, especially in such times as Brexit and recent austerity...to help our British companies thrive. Just a thought.
Comment 522.2	@Adrian Riley if that&#39;s true then good on you and if you support brexit I called you a socialist since you seem okay with taking money and property from people who are well of simply they&#39;re successful as for pedo stuff I&#39;ll need evidence though I don&#39;t doubt that there everywhere

Comment 528.1	Upjohn At least it’s not an exercise in the Nazi fascism that is the EU Parliament and Commission...farewell EU.....it’s been real....real treachery
Comment 528.2	@Jason Devon hes never been anywhere since his family came in the 1650s XD
Comment 528.3	Is that what you say when you go abroad and take in their culture?  Culture is identity and identity is good.
Comment529	Exactly what&#39;s the point of this charade? The measures she reads out are nothing to do with her. She didn&#39;t think them up, she may or may not approve, she won&#39;t understand lots of them. So why not just publish a list of the lies and nonsense and leave her out of it?
Comment 529.1	@Grey Witch no. I&#39;m not a Tory.  And it is as simple as bettering yourself.  Takes time and risk. As you yourself ventured to do. I have also worked for myself. Without risk we are nothing.  Good luck to you,  l mean that. Even if l don&#39;t agree with everything you say.
Comment 529.2	@jimmy2minutes yes I have as it happens. So then what I did was look for a better job. Oh I got all the usual nonsense about being over qualified, and getting back to me and the like, the usual stuff you know. In real life of course, it isn&#39;t as simple as saying &quot;I don&#39;t like this job so I&#39;ll get a better one&quot;. Sometimes there <b>are</b> no &#39;better&#39; jobs to be had. Sometimes, people are so afraid of losing the little they have, that they stay where it&#39;s safe.<br />I&#39;d put good money on you being a Tory for your lack of empathy, belief in cloud cuckoo land and the myth that anyone can better themself if only they work harder.<br />In truth that&#39;s nonsense of course.<br />In the end, I realised that working hard for someone else, only made that person wealthier. So I worked for myself. I would <b>never</b> work for someone else again, and I pity those who have to.
Comment 529.3	@Grey Witch sounds like I&#39;m being stalked.
Comment 529.4	psst. It&#39;s &#39;you&#39;re&#39;. It&#39;s no secret I voted remain. You might get a clue from my profile picture. <br />But yes, if someone has no experience of something, then I would indeed suppose they have no understanding.<br />I have no experience of building a pond so I wouldn&#39;t understand how it&#39;s done. I have no experience on working in mental health, so I wouldn&#39;t understand what <b>that&#39;s</b> like.<br />She has no experience worrying whether to pay the rent or the heating bill this month. She has no experience of having to use a food bank to feed her children. She has no experience of what it&#39;s like to live on a sink estate, so I think it&#39;s reasonable to assume that she won&#39;t understand a lot of what she read out, that appertains to those things.
Comment 529.5	@Grey Witch have you ever had a zero hours contract? I have. So that makes me more qualified than you. So then what l did was get a proper job. That simple. Anyone who stays in a zero hours contact job for any length of time is just an idiot. They are alright for a quick fix and that&#39;s all. If your going to  moan about it you get what you deserve.

Comment 530.3	@Alfred Angelici Oh, are they peaceniks?
Comment 530.4	@gustavo stradella No Brexiters should be ashamed, the first and most important purposes of the EU were to prevent a Third World War and another Holocaust and this Brexiter gang is vandalising that.

Comment 534.3	What about Black Rod?
Comment535	Not a single important sentence.
Comment 535.1	gary63693 <br />Lol. Oh yeh is it that obvious, hm? I wonder why all the fuss then; they should ask you what‘s up, I think that would be the best way forward 🙄
Comment 535.2	@Naweed Khan National disaster? you utter fool. In the short term, things will get a bit ugly, but in the long term, we are smart country and can overcome those hurdles
Comment 535.3	Ari Onassis-Sugen Yep. But I’m not the Queen addressing millions of affected people amidst a national disaster. Unfortunately.
Comment536	A GREAT KINGDOM/MONARCHY/COUNTRY, Allowed unelected EU Bureaucrats , To Control The LAWS , WATERS, &amp; The Lives of it&#39;s People. It doesn&#39;t Make Sense to Me, FREEDOM and DEMOCRACY to The PEOPLE.
Comment 536.1	@Grey Witch Why Did I even have Time to Talk at Length with You, Forgetting That You are a REMAINER LOL, let&#39;s Just Wait and See How it Ends. I am a FREE Soul, &amp; Want UK to be FREE, &amp; For DEMOCRACY to Win, I&#39;m Out.
Comment 536.2	@Danny Israel Surly the reasons for leaving should have been known before the referendum?<br />Why is it that when Brexiters get asked, first they come up with some nonsense, then they don&#39;t want to discuss it any more?
Comment 536.3	@Grey Witch You Will Soon Know The REASON Why We VOTED BREXIT Pam, I&#39;m Done.
Comment 536.4	@Danny Israel If we can&#39;t trade with the outside world, where do our electronics come from? (China mostly). Ever been in a supermarket and bought bananas and oranges?How about New Zealand lamb? We don&#39;t grow them in the UK, nor tea and coffee. So please explain, since we <b>are</b> trading with the rest of the world, what makes you think we aren&#39;t?<br />What do you mean by controlling our waters?<br />Our laws are sovereign and always have been. The EU doesn&#39;t involve itself in the sovereign laws of <b>any</b> of the member states.<br />It seems <b>you</b> are the one who needs to research and I don&#39;t mean by reading the Sun.
Comment 536.5	@Grey Witch Do Your Research, and You would Know, Or Wait Till We Left The EU, &amp; Everything will be disclose to You. But Here are Few, We can&#39;t Trade with Outside World, We don&#39;t Control Our Waters, and Our LAWS? Research More.
Comment537	This elderly lady reads much, much better than most public speakers in radio and television nowadays.And, at 93,  she certainly seems to have enough fuel to keep her going a few more years. Amazing.
Comment 537.1	You&#39;ve just validated my comment with that lol.
Comment 537.2	pam Thompson-Clarke-Reynolds-Bowers-Burton   How do you know Were you Ever a queen?
Comment 537.3	yeah. Imagine if <b>all</b> women had a life with every luxury, not a moment&#39;s worry or stress, the best of everything. They <b>too</b> would live until a great age. Sadly, most ordinary people have a life full of stress and hard work and worry about whether they can afford to pay their rent. That takes its toll. People in the poorest areas of the country, die before they are 60.
Comment538	Britain desrves worst.
Comment 538.1	@Adnan Aslan,    <br />I now understand why Indian Hindus are kicking out you offensive  Muslims from India!!!!!!
Comment 538.2	@Thiago Augusto I&#39;m a Pakistani, and what i know, British ruled over an empire which was 27% of global GDP then, and left with 3% and literacy rate of 17% after century long colonisation. And also given the Kashmir dispute and impeding futher human development in terms of education and health because we both nations are forced to spend over defence more than humans. On the other side, Palestinian issue was also a Brithish gift to middle East. Divided Africa into unnatural boundaries, which resulted in divisions of ethnic communities amomg different countries giving rise to civil strifes. And so....
Comment 538.3	Why are you saying it ? No one deserves worse. Imperialism is natural in our human behaviour
Comment 538.4	@Cool Dude Imperialism and post-colonial hardships of third world.
Comment 538.5	Why do you hate us?
Comment539	As usual all opposition parties putting it down , BBC parading LABOUR and LIBERALS  remoaner MPs telling us again they are ready for election ! Yet when challenged to have one back down with USUAL excuse ,its a set up by Tories . Truth is they are shit scared because they will both drop loads of seats especially LABOUR 💩💩
Comment540	Rot in hell family of child abusers.
Comment541	Keep Britain: Anglo-saxon, Welsh, and Irish.
Comment 541.1	@Shalm no I have provided ample evidence,  all you&#39;ve done is bullshit and ramble on. No fault of mine that you refuse to read anything presented before you.
Comment 541.2	@Peoples Republic of Ninj You have yet to provide an argument.
Comment 541.3	@Shalm you&#39;re ignorance is overwhelming,  by all means continue on with your moronic ideas of the make up of Britain, the facts are on my side. You have much to learn and I don&#39;t have the patience to educate you.
Comment 541.4	@Peoples Republic of Ninj Also, you&#39;ve been arguing about the natives of Britain &quot;not existing&quot; since the start. Don&#39;t play coy, you pathetic mongrel.
Comment 541.5	@Peoples Republic of Ninj So much text, but so little content. <br />Angles were only ruling class and they used apartheid-like societal structure to separate the natives from themselves.<br />Norse immigrants and violent settlers, didn&#39;t come in massive numbers and really only stayed on the north eastern side of england. <br />Normans who came over to england, were all high class people who interbred with high class anglo-saxons (A minority of a minority).<br />Romans were only ruling elite in Britain. <br />Blacks, who were here when slavery ended was extremely minuscule, as most african-bought slaves were sent to america, NOT europe. Chinese workers, would come to work in Great Britain for a certain amount of time, under a contract or sometimes of freewill, then would head back to China with their newly gained money. These chinese workers, would then go off to form the higher class people of modern china today. <br />Britain has never been Racially diverse, and the only time you can mention Britain being &quot;culturally diverse&quot; is when we&#39;ve been invaded. We&#39;ve assimilated those similar to us already. <br />Africans, pakistanis, the Chinese, etc, these people are not similar to us in anyway-shape or form. They form their own cultures within Britain. <br /><br />Also, that fact you&#39;ve resorted to baseless adhoms, shows how incredibly lost you are in each and every argument you&#39;ve &#39;tried&#39; to engage in.

Comment 545.1	@Jason Devon You all bow before another human as if you&#39;re inferior in some way.. your culture is a joke.
Comment 545.2	If this was happening in a foreign country, I bet you&#39;d go weak at the knees for it.  This is our culture and if you don&#39;t like it, shut up or leave.
Comment 545.3	Bailey I wouldn’t mind if she actually had any power but all that pomp and ceremony for naught. She’s totally unimportant.

Comment 551.1	@Grey Witch well said
Comment 551.2	you are deluded. Where were human rights when the government decided that highly flammable cladding was to be used on Grenfell tower? After all, most of the inhabitants were only immigrants. Where were human rights when it was decided not to bother installing a sprinkler system in the same tower block, which might have saved lives?<br />Where are human rights when disabled and terminally ill people are told they must work or die?<br />Where are human rights when old people have to decide whether they want to eat, or whether to heat their homes in winter?
Comment 551.3	Why must you use muslim to respect..

Comment 552.5	@DANNYBOY73 omg you are severly triggered multiple comments are you ok snowflake. would you like me to send you the samaritans phone number
Comment553	British logic, we need to have an unelected Head Of State, because it&#39;s good for tourism. Also Brit logic, we need to leave the EU because it&#39;s un-democratic, even though we vote for MEP representation.  But we got to leave it because reasons, but we are totally keeping the House of Lords and the Queen, because reasons.
Comment 553.1	@Media you thought that was obtuse? I don&#39;t think it means what you think it means...
Comment 553.2	@Peoples Republic of Ninj Reason one had a vote, reason two people voted, so on. <br /><br /><br /><br />Also no one really does know why, lots of people have theories why people voted the way they did. <br /><br /><br /><br />I await your next smart ass, obtuse comment.
Comment 553.3	@Media it&#39;s A reason, not &quot;reasons&quot; dumbass. You used the word &quot;reasons&quot; in a nebulous sense to give the impression that no one really knows why, that it was pure happenstance. It was a democratic process, did that help?
Comment 553.4	@Peoples Republic of Ninj Okay, Mr well informed, please explain how having a vote doesn&#39;t count as &quot;reasons&quot;.
Comment554	Hail her highness!!

Comment 556.2	@Oheh84 of course everyone&#39;s an idiot except for you
Comment 556.3	Jason Devon haha!! Yes Britain does have culture but this is nonsense. Brexit is nonsense and those who voted for it didn’t understand what they were voting for, and those who led the Brexit campaign haven’t a clue how to implement it without causing great harm.
Comment 556.4	Yes, we actually have culture, how &quot;messed up&quot;.

Comment 559.3	Oh tickety poo, Cheerios, Fruitloops. One Eyed Bisping. Eel pie. Private industry supported by the U.S. has kept companies like Space X at the top. Simply give the U.S. money, they will make the good stuff. Stick to radar. Whigs! Bucket head hides in the curtains. Boris Putin. Trump Wannabe. At least they invented the 🐱 and have had running water for 3 yrs. Save TingTong.

Comment 560.1	Corbyn and the likes will be here until the last draculian blood of capitalism, but these feudal overlords should already have been torn asunder....
Comment 560.2	Every country has them, but at least we made a use for them over here.
Comment 560.3	More why do we still have communists and socialists in government like Corbyn.
Comment561	Queen is always a queen, but now queen is on the floor of the other one
Comment562	Jo Swinsons thigh was not touched at anytime in the duration of this speech.
Comment 562.1	Did anyone ask her about revoking Art 50 or whether its a coincidence that Swinsons husbands company received 3.5 billion Euros from the EU?.
Comment 562.2	She&#39;s going to ask why , at next parliament question time 😇😇
Comment563	The Queen loved sucking huge black man penis on her Africa tours while Philip was off on safari shooting elephants and giraffes.

Comment 564.1	@Ry Rilo Well, then, I shall open a conversation on a new comment, viz: &quot;Her Majesty&#39;s a very nice girl<br />But she doesn&#39;t have a lot to say ...&quot;<br />Can you completely the quatrain? Then maybe leavalonialists can comunipolocate?
Comment 564.2	Anna Lieff-Saxby ..sometimes. Other times i&#39;m a leaveme alonialist.
Comment 564.3	@Stoney Sloth a product of the church which lied about the true divinity they found east...<br />Now Europe is full pedeos ,gay and you name...the queen heads such.... A contaminated society
Comment 564.4	@Ry Rilo Aha! A conversationalist?
Comment565	I&#39;m not a coward.
Comment566	No more forced multiculturalism. <br />No more genocidal levels of mass immigration. <br />It is like permitting a genocide on the English ethnicity.
Comment567	Does that mean when we call the police they WON&#39;T take their sweet time even when they are around the corner? Schools not forcing parents to buy their uniforms instead of simple uniform from a supermarkets. Because not every family are sneaky rich. 75% of England is mostly poor when 25% are rich. I am surprise no one been fired yet. If nothing in her speech is honoured might result in a few people in the Government.
Comment 567.1	"Don&#39;t expect any of it to be honoured friend. It&#39;s just a sales pitch. A lot of it is just general &quot;woolly&quot; statement that are unquantifiable drivel. <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=5m50s"">5:50</a> &quot;my Government will take steps to make work fairer, introducing measures that will support those working hard.&quot; It sounds nice but means f**k all. You can take the whole speech and if you break it down most of it would not stand a test of whether it was a Smart goal - Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Realistic and Time bound. Indeed, if he cut out the froth she could probably have been done in a third of the time."
Comment 567.2	@sir Beanalot Try typing a sentence wtf is that mess of a comment
Comment 567.3	Children need to be clothed. A uniform is clothing. Greedy parents, who would rather buy drink, smoke s, etc., for themselves, grumble about needing to buy school uniforms. Parents with a victim mentality do the same: We are just too poor to buy a uniform; we need to buy a lot of CRAP and junk food instead.

Comment570	Great, a woman who should have given up power 30 years ago, from a family that stole power centuries ago, speaks for a man who was never elected. Throw the whole lot in the bin, especially including the house of lords and all this bullshit pagentry, and bring in proportional representation or some other 21st century form of leadership.

Comment 576.2	@A-J Hartung if you imagine that you are fooling anyone with your claim to live in the UK (nobody refers  to it as &#39;GB&#39;) then you are fooling yourself.

WHatever Carter earned, at least the <b>did</b> earn it. This family is one of the wealthiest in the world, yet they stash their money on offshore tax havens so as <b>not</b> to pay their dues and help the poorest in the country, and the government makes poor people pay to keep her and the rest of the parasites, in a life of comfort.

Comment579	end this monarchy Zionist kingdom u.k or stay tf out of other countries matters
Comment 579.1	You also appear to be an anti-semite.
Comment 579.2	@ABadPilot all fake the house of common, Lords..look at their prime minister just bcoz he&#39;s a puppet he is among the peasants
Comment 579.3	@cat stevens Thats what the followers of the nazi did blind ignorance
Comment 579.4	@A Random Saracen boris johnson is a proud zionist and epstein (zionist) was getting her son kids to f..k
Comment 579.5	Don’t respond to this idiot they don’t deserve it, ignorance is bliss.
Comment580	End of freedom of movement for 66 million UK subjects, 3.5 million EU citizens go through the humiliation to apply and prove they have the right to stay, 1.5 million Brits in the EU neglected by their own government and the Queen, friendly cooperation cannot be established with using war language and depicting EU as the evil empire.... Clowns in one of the greatest circuses, only the White House beats this.
Comment 580.1	@AD Yeah, Bob the Builder, John the fisherman, Jane the farmer who believes in conspiracy theories, Mary the housewife who dropped out from school at 15 and has got 4 kids from 4 husbands and no working experience...and the list goes on. All of them getting the news from Facebook and Daily Mail.
Comment 580.2	Nobody was ever able to elucidate Bob the British Warehouse worker quite as to &#39;how&#39; unlimited unregulated inter EU freedom of labor into the UK benefitted him personally one iota, and because nobody could manage to do so or even bothered to consider Bob the British Warehouse Worker at all in any of this, Bob the British Warehouse Worker now sees no reason to feel the slightest empathy with the losing side. No empathy offered, none returned.
Comment 580.3	Anne Ty - I was offering you a solution to your problem, If you don’t take my advice that’s up to you. You can resist all you want this is going to happen so get used to it.
Comment581	I think Queen pro Brexit...
Comment 581.1	Ok.. Let&#39;s sing &quot;GUY Bless the Queen&quot;...
Comment 581.2	The Queen loved sucking huge black man penis on her Africa tours while Philip was off on safari shooting elephants and giraffes,.
Comment 581.3	I know she is pro peadophile
Comment582	So now the Queen is just wheeled out to try and convince the public that we still have a government bordering on competent? I&#39;m not convinced.  What is the point in any of this? It&#39;s nothing but spin without follow through. Time for BIG changes and a more competent government, perhaps it&#39;s time we stopped embracing an increasingly out of date and clearly dysfunctional system.
Comment 582.1	Totally agree the bits are sycophantic when it comes to this old bat, yet she drives past hundreds of homeless every day and has yet to sort that problem out
Comment583	All those queen cloths gold,crown is stolen from india bloody thives

Comment 584.1	puke
Comment 584.2	She just endorsed Brexit.
Comment585	Whoa, out on the 31st of October from the Queen.
Comment 585.1	@Nyssa well...parliament is full of witches, goblins, trolls and the EU is full of the undead so...
Comment 585.2	@Peoples Republic of Ninj Halloween tho ominous day if you believe in that sort of thing
Comment 585.3	@Nyssa that&#39;s a relief...
Comment 585.4	@Peoples Republic of Ninj op&#39;s original comment was hard to understand. I thought he was saying video of the queen posted on the 31st... My mistake for misinterpiting his words!
Comment586	Totally love how there is such a show of power in our  monarchs, if only her words could be true!! All I can think of with this speech is! might as well piss in the wind, think you might get soaked 🤔

Comment593	Long live our noble Queen
Comment 593.1	@KFC you keep making the same comment. Keep your homoerotic racist fantasies to yourself.
Comment 593.2	The Queen loved sucking huge black man penis on her Africa tours while Philip was off on safari shooting elephants and giraffes.
Comment594	Wow her crown love it
Comment595	Sorry Mamm for taking the mickey out of you when we were stuck next to each other in that traffic jam on the M4
Comment596	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=4m51s"">4:51</a> official police state on the way"
Comment597	I&#39;m so conflicted, I want to make a republican comment but I feel like I&#39;m picking on a frail old lady.  🤷‍♀️
Comment 597.1	She is a great person and has dedicated hrr entire life to her country. Even at 93 she never gives up.
Comment 597.2	@Stoney Sloth hmm you called john a peado hmmm hypocrite
Comment598	he lie to the queen, has no shame, now she has to read out his rubbish
Comment 598.1	You ignorant fool, go back to school and educate yourself. Maybe your brain will start thinking.
Comment 598.2	"She doesn&#39;t have to read anything..she is the queen and yet you still blame boris.this is the queen speaking, when we leave on the 31october she <a href=""http://said.so/"">said.so</a> we all might as well accept it now and try work together instead of each other."
Comment 598.3	She sounds like she is of sound mind and capable of making her own decisions here.  She isn&#39;t mumbling, stammering, losing her place, etc.....  She has a quick wit for someone her age.  It&#39;s more like you don&#39;t like what she has to say, so you blame someone who is just doing the job he was elected to do.
Comment599	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0XXYk9zdC_8&amp;t=4m08s"">4:08</a> Bercow knows whats up... this is a sham"
Comment 599.1	@Craig Evans 😁
Comment 599.2	@annie smith I have to be honest...and in the end the people have their say and keep their sovereignty, British pound as also keep their own British military. As for the nasty eu....well they crumble within 20 years due to United kingdom not bank rolling them anymore and everyone lives free of the eu dictatorship...the end. 🤣🤣🤣
Comment 599.3	@Craig Evans have you ever thought about writing a children&#39;s fairy tale book.
Comment 599.4	Well either way the queen as spoken now. Bercow as well as me or you can&#39;t do fuck all tbh. So now maybe it&#39;s time to accept it and work towards a brighter future?
Comment600	Such a shame they&#39;ve abused the power and voice of the Queen. if she was 50 years younger , she would kick your ass.  Seriously this is the day we need to think about removing the monarchy .. pandering to the misinformed minority is a bad idea
Comment 600.1	Never you will have to have a war to remove her long live the Queen.
Comment 600.2	Tom Buckley do not hold your breath....
Comment601	I will wake up one day and realise brexit was just a bad dream
Comment 601.1	Not while Boris and his pals think its a wet dream
Comment602	Don&#39;t believe your son!
Comment603	Thank you Ma&#39;am.  Making the environment law.<br />The police tax revenues needs filling. Legalising cannabis will do this. Look at Colorado, Canada, California and other places.
Comment 603.1	Problem is sharm that alcohol  caused 7697 deaths last year still can go in a shop and purchase it I&#39;m against alcohol drugs ect problem is it still isnt going to stop people smoking cause deaths still ain&#39;t going to stop people it&#39;s about education so people can be aware that there is risk with it but the police are at a loseing battle how much money and  time does it cost to arrest people for drugs I can tell you there loseing a lot and with the strain on the police force at the moment whats the point in all the millions wasted when ppl are going to do it anyway might aswell save the money legalise it and may be put the money into educating how bad it is rather than spend the money convicting for it
Comment 603.2	@Shalm yet theres evidence it helps depression anxiety pain c-ptsd inflammation n slows down cancer growth.<br />It actually has medical use<br />Alcohol doesnt n constantly by every measure more dangerous^^
Comment 603.3	@Shalm this is why we advertise and dissuade people from taking them. If they do its their own fault for not having self control when all the warnings are out there
Comment 603.4	@Richard Price It would also damage our societies, and future generations. Life is not simply about money, subscribing to that line of thought is why european countries are so plagued today.
Comment 603.5	I don&#39;t even smoke weed but even I no the tax on it could help the economy end some drug wars <br />Create more jobs tourism so on ect before you start going on about pollution from weed ect please go on about China
Comment604	Just stay in a Reformed Europe as in the end of Hate speech Laws for the Whole of Europe and Tighter Immigration Control for the Whole of Europe.
Comment605	MY GOVERNMENT WILL GET RID OF JEREMY CORBYN 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Comment 605.1	Why would they do that <br />They would have no one to blame their crimes on

Comment 609.2	Annie, that was an excellent rejoinder, and I wish I hadn’t been taking a sip of my iced tea while I read it. All over my phone... lol
Comment 609.3	Gumball Watterson I haven’t twisted any facts, I’ve given you facts that youse aren’t accepting, simple as that really, nuff said on the topic.
Comment 609.4	@CynosaGamer You can&#39;t twist facts bro. There is a thing called a toothbrush you know.
Comment 609.5	Huey Freeman They May be “known”<br />because that stereotype has been around since the 40s where working class people couldn’t afford dentistry. Sure they have some people with bad dental hygiene today, but when you take FACTS into consideration and not STEREOTYPES, British teeth are actually some of the best. Dunno how it’s not relevant when it’s facts matey, the stereotype continues to exist because of the Jezza show but I’m talking facts.<br /><br />BTW, give me some celebrities as some examples because you have just generalised.
Comment610	I wonder why British people have such nasty looking teeth??. 🤢
Comment611	Hearing the internet concerns from a monarch is bizaare.
Comment612	....and Sharia law will be implemented soon and Islam will be State religion because Islam is a religion of peace not Christianity. Thank you!
Comment 612.1	Idiot
Comment 612.2	@General Guile I know loads of English muslims. Muslims can have any nationality and be any skin colour
Comment 612.3	It will never happen because English common la says Every person is free to choose the religion they desire. So If an English person wants to be a Muslim then they&#39;re free to do so. What I do mind is the genocidal levels of mass immigration to England.
Comment 612.4	yeah a religion of peace because your prophet is pedophile and isis got inspired by his book. you hit women and take them as slaves; stfu
Comment613	Boris gave a speech at the UN warning us of the threat of A.I yet there is nothing in the queens speech about this.  <br /><br />As for police saftey, what about the police communication system Tetra that uses high level microwaves that have been linked to mental health, cancers and much more.  <br /><br />As for addressing the past in Northern Ireland, the way forward is for a united Ireland.  <br /><br />Whats the government doing about the male suicide rate which is at record levels.  <br /><br />The uk government is not fit for purpose.
Comment 613.1	5G
Comment 613.2	AI doesn&#39;t exist.  Just hype and fear.
Comment614	She should have made a speech on British people&#39;s gross crooked teeth.
Comment615	Usual four to one biased Remainer BBC reporting....nothing changes....death of democracy................disgusting as ALWAYS.

Comment 617.4	@Stoney Sloth So by your logic he&#39;s guiltly by association, clown.
Comment 617.5	@Prime Minister There is no god kid
Comment618	What a load of old pomp and circumstance.  I am definitely not a royalist and I mean no disrespect to the queen but the whole system in this country is just archaic traditionalist bullshit.  And my god how smug did boris look at the beginning of that video!?  At this point in time I could give less of a shit what happens regarding brexit and deal or no deal (ha Noel Edmunds should have been in charge by the sound of that) it&#39;s dragged on for so long it&#39;s over shadowing other much more important things that need addressing in this country.
Comment619	BBC Socialist bias anti British , nothing on the Majority that voted out , they have been talked Ng and pushing a second referendum , BBC needs to be closed down .

Comment624	She&#39;s still alive and that means we&#39;re still lucky.
Comment 624.1	@Jessica Josephs If it&#39;s true life started in Africa, then we&#39;re all related.  You might think you&#39;re white, but you is black.
Comment 624.2	@DANNYBOY73 <br />yer, I kinda only know the song because I think he&#39;s cute hahhaha if I was called the Queen of England (UK) the question of how English I am might come up. But it turns out I&#39;m not the Queen.
Comment 624.3	@Jessica Josephs I have no idea what he&#39;s singing either..
Comment 624.4	@Jessica Josephs So obviously she&#39;s more English than you then.
Comment 624.5	"@Prime Minister <br />You&#39;re not a very effect troll, do better next time. <br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1eHKf-dMwo&amp;feature=share"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o1eHKf-dMwo&amp;feature=share</a>"
