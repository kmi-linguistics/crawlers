Comment1	We were told by Major that if a deal was not reached by a certain date after article 50 was started. then we would be out no deal,,  so whats with this shit we were not told about a no deal ?????  get a brain and check..
Comment2	HAHA.. FUCK THE DUP.. NOBODY GIVES TWO SHITS BOUT IRELAND ANYWAY
Comment3	Who the hell listens or trusts a single thing these crafty b&#39;stards say?<br />Honestly, f&#39; &#39;em with knobs on.
Comment 3.1	this is the problem though mate.. people arent generally very well informed.  they just retweet things.  so the answer is that many &#39;listen&#39; .  trust doesnt come into it.
Comment4	Its a shame this is the best Boris could get that keeps us still agreeing to EU rules until 2020 where they could effectively cook up new rules until then while they get our 39 billion with free trade but still tied in. No deal is still miles better as you CAN NOT MAKE DEALS WITH ZIONIST RUN BAEUROCRATS
Comment5	Michel Barnier is Scum Bag
Comment6	Laura kuenssberg has been unfit for purpose throughout Brexit.  I want her GONE from the BBC.  She is an aweful journalist, and biased in the extreme.
Comment7	"<a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23DEAL"">#DEAL</a> with it"
Comment8	BARNIER THE CROOK SHOULD BE IN THE HUMAN RIGHTS COURT FOR CRIMES AGAINST SOVEREIGN COUNTRY&#39;S.
Comment9	We want completely out of the E.U so lets have an election and finally sort this shit out.
Comment10	Mr. Johnson, pls pay a &quot;patent fee&quot; to China&#39;s one country two systems invented by Mr. Deng Xiaoping.
Comment11	this is not Brexit and they sold out Ireland.
Comment 11.1	Of course this is brexit - just not the one YOU were hoping for
Comment12	it still stands if parliment vote it out that we still leave no deal Brexit. Remainers wont vote this in nor will the d.u.p nor the liberals. It&#39;s either a election another referendum which is a joke. Or an extension but i don&#39;t believe an extension will be granted. it sounds like another May deal. It all sucks. It&#39;s not Brexit.
Comment13	At the end, the European Union has won the blame game. And this practically<br />with the same deal they signed with Teresa May. Big win
Comment 13.1	Only they won the blame-diffusion game
Comment14	I sincerely hope that everyone had and will work out in good faith the resolution to this crises. I hope Parliament will end it’s ceaseless grandstanding and find a deal agreeable to their constituents and not their own personal agenda.
Comment15	Just don&#39;t understand why and how the EU is giving Boris what he is asking for..knowing very well he could just turn against them when he gets what he really want.<br /><br />Just like what he did to the DUP earlier Boris was assuring them, now he stubbed them in back for something more interesting. He thinks they will sustain from voting..if they don&#39;t support his  latest Boris. May&#39;s deal.<br /><br />The DUP will prefer no Brexit then a deal which will affect the Union.<br />But Boris and his supporters aren&#39;t really that interested in the union even with  all good talks about it.<br /><br /> MPs should remember the humiliation of their unlawful suspension. ..and that walk of shame...they had to go through.<br /><br />Boris  the team responsible for that unlawful act and  after tricking the queen. They have no regrets what so ever. Now they are so desperate for those MPs to  vote for their new May deal which is much harder and damaging than the original.
Comment16	ParLIEment is corrupt to the core.<br />It needs replacing with normal people.
Comment 16.1	"You already posted this under a different video. <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=%23lazytroll"">#lazytroll</a>"
Comment17	ParLIEment is corrupt to the core.<br />It needs replacing with normal people.
Comment 17.1	Are you really so proud of your little ParLIEment joke?
Comment 17.2	no matter how many times you repeat it, the next election will return the same people to the parliament.  Voters always want to change the other MP&#39;s, not their own.
Comment18	ParLIEment is corrupt to the core.<br />It needs replacing with normal people.
Comment 18.1	Blank Account Shill Boris’ “deal” is a trap locking us into the EU, stopping us controlling our own coastal waters, foreign policy and tax rates! Reject this deal! No deal and WTO the only option!
Comment 18.2	@Milton77 😂😂😂omfg your away in the head they ain&#39;t normal people.He means people not born out of that rich vagina with a golden spoon at birth
Comment 18.3	Blank Account Shill Indeed! Normal people. Like Johnson and Rees-Mogg
Comment19	Corbyn should go and live in the north pole he is the biggest prick in the world
Comment20	Brexit deal is the result of intensive work... thats a laugh, intensive work doing what? sniffing coke of naked rent boys. This has all been a theatrical show for the masses.
Comment21	Not what I voted for:- hoping this doesn&#39;t pass. Then, its back to Farage.
Comment 21.1	demonhalo67 Farage just said he wants an extension...😂
Comment22	There wont be a deal    dont be deceived
Comment23	Another recipe from May&#39;s cookbook. Pass the sick bag.
Comment24	Barnier doing his best Von Ribbentrop impersonation again...
Comment25	Boris&#39;s Brexit deal is going to be passed by Parliament. Because . . . .This new plan will keep only Northern Ireland closely aligned with the EU rules, specifically on goods.<br />This avoids any checks on the island of Ireland, though checks will still have to happen on goods moving to or from the island of Ireland from the rest of Britain. But CRUCIALLY,<br />the whole of the United Kingdom — including Northern Ireland — will get to leave the EU customs union. The arrangements are kind of complicated — for example, the UK will have<br />to apply and collect EU tariffs if any goods going from the rest of Britain are at risk of entering Ireland, otherwise known as EU territory. However, leaving the EU customs union<br />means that the whole of the United Kingdom will be free to negotiate new trade deals with countries outside the EU. This is a massive improvement over Mrs May’s proposed deal.
Comment26	Someone needs to tell that woman to shut up. I’m trying to listen to this man here
Comment27	Nooooo, the series is coming to an end.
Comment28	Tell British taxpayers .military and fishermen ............HOW MUCH.?????????.. Financial commitments will be honoured????...... A £bn a month for up to 3years???.?.   Britain connected for 3years???. It will need Farage to stay alert!!!!.... Will Brexit party continue to attend EU parliament during this period???...?...   Should Britain manage to get clear of the EU great care will need to be taken that remain politicians do not reconnect Britain to EU.......  Britain buys more from EU than EU buys from Britain... Tariff free trade ?.... Great for EU.......Hope to hear what is good for Britain..
Comment 28.1	NO TAXATION WITHOUT REPRESENTATION
Comment29	Cant you see what they have done! Delay Brexit! Get the people fed up with the whole process. PRETEND to negotiate another treaty, The people will vote yes. YOUR STILL IN THE E.U
Comment30	Thee most important above all is to get the agreement for the good of Europeans people. Boris Johnson and Jean-Claud Juncker, thank you all.
Comment31	What is the deal made ????? Boris should explain the great deal hatched between the EU and U.K....Brexit should look like brexit not just a agreement or a treaty which already existed between the two with not much of difference....if this happens then the Westminster should not agree to this and oppose this....finally we will head for a no deal brexit....
Comment32	Corbyn is the one destroying every deal in parliament, he will be solely responsible for a no deal Brexit..why? because it will be the ONLY thing he cannot stop! He has done nothing but STOP every deal in Parliament for the last 3 years. Get rid of him and we can move towards a deal on Brexit. He destroys everybody&#39;s hard work every single time like a spoilt kid..&quot;No, No I wont vote for this&quot;, how can he ever be Prime Minister....EVER??? I wont ever vote Labour again because of him, along with 5 million other EX Labour voters...
Comment33	Anyone remember the policeman in that TV program ...........translator please
Comment34	We voted to get OUT
Comment35	You must be jokin
Comment36	Would love to no where his getting the money for 20,000 more tax collectors from because it ain&#39;t going to be from my tax pocket what a dummy.
Comment 36.1	พิมพา สิงห์คํา of course it is, dummy
Comment37	Now the world can find some peace. This had to happen. The Queen made it so because Trump has spoken. Now the vatican and the IMF. KGo Trump go.
Comment38	Garbage
Comment39	And as for &#39;taking back control&#39; - of what? Our railways or utilities all of which are owned by foreign companies!
Comment40	We already have a good deal within the EU: we have our own currency; we are not part of the Schengen Agreement so we control our own borders; the bulk of net immigration is from OUTSIDE the EU so 100% under our control - so why isn&#39;t it better controlled; we have numerous opt-outs. Mrs Thatcher would be horrified; her greatest achievement was the Single Market where all good can travel within the EU with no cumbersome paperwork and under one set of pan EU regulations. The Single Market + the Free Trade Area has brought many billions of pounds of investment into the UK which is already seeping away especially in the car industry where the Japanese are now likely to move factories. Johnson has spent a lifetime writing inaccuracies about the EU &amp; as for a trade deal with Trump it will be on his terms. We all know the EU needs reforming which Mrs T would have done from within the EU. This a historic blunder led by ideologues. db
Comment41	The only thing that hurts is all the money we now have to pay
Comment 41.1	Someone needs to ask for a detailed breakdown of the bill so we can see what we will be paying for. Curious how we are never told. The EU will have a hole in its budget which it wants us to plug. But the EU will be proportionately smaller so it should not need it. So why should we pay a penny?
Comment42	think  they are Relived  ,,,   they  have  a  chance  of  a  deal
Comment43	The possible end of the U.K beckons.  The end of the two-party system in this country is now also in sight for absolutely sure. In fact it’s now in its death throws (imho that is).  In future, I can envision some new form or system of  a <b>GOVERNMENT OF NATIONAL UNITY</b> that will be set in place. I repeat, the old party political system <b>IS DYING</b> before our very eyes.  PS. Good luck getting this though Parliament BoJo, I think you’re gonna be thwarted again!
Comment 43.1	What stands in the way of a government of national unity is that Corbyn wants to run it. No one wants him to, not even his own party. It is Corbyn&#39;s ambition that is the spanner in the works. Always has been. Since his suspiciously lukewarm effort to campaign against leaving.
Comment44	He cannot keep the smile off his face, he even wore a less impressive suit for the occasion, yes folks that&#39;s us the voters, what a dinner they will have on our tax tonight as our children worry about LBGT and climate change, breed on folks for the gratification of the new army to come.
Comment45	THIS DEAL is UK capitulation to STRONG-ARM  EU EMPIRE force.
Comment 45.1	You mean we should have declared war on the EU?
Comment46	Mays deal warmed up unbelievable
Comment47	BORIS  is  happy about  it  ,,,   but  will  he  get  Enough  Votes  ?   just  Back  this  and  lets  all  Move  on
Comment 47.1	Parliament insists on a deal. The last 3 times they were asked to approve one, they rejected it. That was before Boris even became PM. Now he is, and they forced him to get a deal, so they can reject it again, and then blame him.
Comment48	All ridiculous hype...this deal, as indeed any deal, stands NO CHANCE of being accepted in the UK parliament. Everyone knows that, especially the DUP and ERG. Clean Break is now the only possible outcome, there will be no extension.
Comment 48.1	"The new deal throws the DUP knuckle-draggers under a bus. As such, it is the least worst outcome, as deals go.There is nothing for Boris to lose by throwing them under the bus because they were never going to agree to anything anyway.The choice the DUP need to be made to understand is that the alternative deal that they also rejected would have resulted in a hard border. The new one at least ensures it does not divide the island, which should thereby prevent bloodshed. If they cannot see that as an improvement, then they are stupid. The only other alternative is no deal at all, and no one is going to let 10 obstructive morons stand in the way of the only deal going."
Comment49	No matter what deal we have on the table labour and all rest of the traitors will vote against it
Comment 49.1	@dakrontu I totally agree
Comment 49.2	Corbyn&#39;s ambition again. To hell with the country as long as he can get himself to be PM. No one wants him as PM except himself. He has been the main obstacle all along.
Comment50	AT LAST  well done boris
Comment 50.1	IF parliament accepts the deal, Boris will be seen (by some at least) as a hero. Enough maybe to win an election victory. Of course that is why Corbyn will happily throw away the deal, resulting in no deal at all, so he can make Boris look bad, hoping to succeed Boris. Corbyn is in it purely for his own ambition to preside over an independent country in which he can implement a Marxist state like his friends in Cuba and Venezuela where he likes to spend his vacations.

Comment58	PEOPLE get out your magnifying Glass and please read the fine print if the EU NWO and the BBC is signing off on it you better do the work and study the facts and let the Truth come to light. Better a clean No deal Brexit than Mays surrender deal with lipstick.
Comment59	this is against British people..Barnier-Juncker-Verhofstad satisfied..?.....this is no good ...what does it cost for UK..?
Comment 59.1	@dakrontu ...agree , absolutely....about French farming , right..dont tell me we have to pay ...dont tell me that ...no way Boris ..be careful
Comment 59.2	"We haven&#39;t seen the bill yet. Or the concocted explanation of why there should be one. They have been pushing this idea that there is &#39;supposed to be&#39; a bill, for so long, that people have come to believe there must be a reason for it. There is: To take advantage of us.Why should the money be going in THEIR direction? Why not to US? For all the years of delay in them getting round to making a trade deal with the US, for example. Where we were forbidden from making one ourselves. And for 40 years of bailing out the French farming industry to keep the tractors off the Champs Elysée, and putting up with the French pompously declaring themselves to have a bigger economy than the UK (because we were SUBSIDISING it).They will want us to just write a blank cheque.You want a trade deal? Another cheque please."
Comment60	Boris has sold the UK to the crooks of the EU against the will of the people. Time to rise and destroy this elite that fucked you deep. Oh wait... you Brits have given up your guns! Too bad. Good luck now.
Comment 60.1	"Like a bunch of ignorant burger-munching middle-aged jerks with beer-bellies in MAGA hats were going to defeat the US Federal government?So we reject the deal? Then what? We are 15 % of the EU. How on earth are we going to defeat the arrogant clique of well-heeled federalist-fantasists who run it? It has been a closed shop for the benefit of big European corporations from the outset. The trade barrier around it is to protect them. You want in, you have to submit to the ruling elite."
Comment61	Aunt Sally Swinson , Gummidge and his gang , Le Chevalier Grieve and the tory fifth column don&#39;t give a hoot ...It won&#39;t get past Parliament ....Surely this was Cummings&#39; plan anyway ?
Comment62	The northern Ireland point sounded a lot like Theresa May &#39;s backstop thing
Comment 62.1	@dakrontu it&#39;s not just that. Dup is rejecting this as well as uk insiders are saying this might not pass parliament
Comment 62.2	You either put the border down the Irish Sea or across the island itself. Better the former. Less likelihood of violence. Had to be one way or the other. Only way to avoid it would be to stay in. But Corbyn insists on &#39;accepting the will of the British people&#39; which is a joke because we were told that leaving would give us lots of clout for a good deal and that turned out to be a lie.
Comment 62.3	The difference is that we will be able to do our own trade deals
Comment63	Why&#39;s everone moaning? what&#39;s so bad about this deal or are you all just parroting what you heard some other person say.
Comment64	No deal is the best deal !!!!!
Comment 64.1	No deal means a hard border across Ireland. Instead it will be down the Irish Sea. Which is a better solution. So what else would no-deal have done for us besides screw that up?
Comment65	FUCK THE GOVERNMENT FUCK THE EU AND BRUSSELS
Comment66	shame this treaty was printed on soft paper..... if it were, it would at least have one use! 64 pages of crap, dealing only with NI the trade going between Ireland and NI equates to a round of drinks as Nige put it the other day, what a load of drivel, Brexit, no deal THAT&#39;S THE ONLY WAY FORWARD......... HEADS UP: WHY DOES THE EU SAY THE DEAL IS GOOD? DERR COS IT KEEPS US TIED TO THEM WITH NO SAY, NO VOTE NO VETO, AND WE HAVE TO PAY THEM FOR IT.......... BORIS, YOU&#39;RE ON YOUR WAY, MY FRIEND, YOU&#39;VE SOILED YOUR PANTS JUST GO NOW!!
Comment67	They forgot to turn the comments of traitors to this country we DONT WANT YOUR TREATY WE VOTED TO LEAVE
Comment 67.1	Milton77 the only Russia troll on here is you labour socialist!

Comment68	This in the long term will mean a united Ireland. The Scotts will demand the same role aply for them. A walk on a very slippery slope has begun.
Comment 68.1	@dakrontu Logic error N. Ireland is lost due to the fact that Catholics have more children. Then you say that many of the Catholics prefere to live in N. Ireland. You must be a Brexitere since the logick is backwards.
Comment 68.2	The unification of Ireland is inevitable as the Catholic population is growing faster than the rest. That said, plenty of Catholics prefer life in NI to life in the Republic. So it won&#39;t flip any time soon.
Comment69	House of Commons...
Comment70	Well done boris you did what you said you would
Comment71	The audio guy needs rubber ducking.
Comment 71.1	Sacking or f&#39;ING?
Comment72	Three effing years to &quot;slightly modify&quot; a trade deal.. for a deal which will probably still fail...this is big govt at its best
Comment 72.1	Why were you expecting such an intractable problem to be dealt with quickly?
Comment73	"Why at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YA5WQA8DvJc&amp;t=09m15s"">09:15</a> does he talk about goats?"
Comment 73.1	He actually says &quot;goods&quot; but sounds like goats :)
Comment74	WE voted to get out. We should not be asking the EU tyrants for a deal. The people have voted to get out.
Comment75	Had she wanted to, May could have had such a deal years ago.
Comment 75.1	"The mistake was to depend on the DUP. That became the obstacle. That problem did not exist until May held an election. She was a poor campaigner. Boris might have done better but the concern was (and still is) that he is a loose cannon.The DUP have effectively neutered themselves by virtue of the fact that there is NOTHING they would agree to. So in effect it does not matter WHICH deal they get to not agree with."
Comment 75.2	Martin Breton Guess it will mostly hinge upon whether or not enough MPs consider the territorial integrity of the UK sacrosanct.
Comment 75.3	Yes. Which begs the question, why would this deal pass now?
Comment76	So the tax haven that is the city of london won&#39;t be getting investigated then.
Comment 76.1	@English Gentleman that&#39;s what I was saying. Would have been much easier for Brussels to audit London than other way.
Comment 76.2	dakrontu Well I am not as sanguine as you are about the survival of the Euro! I most definitely agree about manufacturing. I come from an area that suffered heavily in the decline of manufacturing and agree it is vital we expand it again. We need more than the service industry string to our bow however well we do it.
Comment 76.3	"The US and the UK and the EU have their tax havens. People in glass houses should not throw stones. There is one street in Delaware where 140,000 businesses are registered. This was pointed out to Obama when he wanted to go after British tax havens.What the EU will do: Once we are out, they will declare that it is not safe for the EU to have its financial centre in an independent country with its own currency. They will then move to establish their OWN financial centre.If we had stayed in, they would eventually have done this anyway, as we do not use the Euro. So, in or out, we are screwed.You can complain all you like about the City of London. But it is responsible for a significant part of the nation&#39;s income and tax-take.OTOH the City has been an obstacle to the building of a stronger manufacturing economy because the best and brightest went into the City for the big bucks. There are people who say the future of First World countries is to hand over such menial work as manufacturing to &#39;inferior&#39; countries/peoples. This is dumb. They will eat us for breakfast. We need to manufacture stuff ourselves. Germany does. And look at its financial situation: Surplus. Not deficit."
Comment 76.4	Sarah-Jayne Mcdonald It couldn&#39;t force one when it was in the EU either. The outgoing head of the EU was responsible for most tax fiddles when he was in power in Luxembourg!
Comment 76.5	@English Gentleman yip both them.....except the EU is more powerful and Britain cant force an audit in the like the EU could when UK was in there.<br />Edit*can&#39;t
Comment77	Kind of funny how nobody actually knows what the deal is. My guess is it will be Brexit, but not as we know it.
Comment 77.1	&quot;It&#39;s Brexit, Spock, but not as we know it...&quot;
Comment 77.2	More of the same not actually Brexit it is another repackaged turd 💩 they call a deal which is indeed another treaty to REMAIN. leave means we walk away and are no longer part of the EU .  The deal is the same deal Brussels cooked up under or should I say over Teresa May except Boris has taken one thing out and called it a miracle of a new deal. It’s definitely not Brexit an exit from the EU.
Comment 77.3	Kind of like what good Brexit itself was going to do and why the all-consuming exit was proposed at all - all a hype and political propaganda
Comment78	If you think a little bit,  NI stays in the EU Single market and customs . The majority part, ends up being the vote to reunite Ireland. <br />They talked in future arrangements  with no tariffs,  is UK becoming something  like Switzerland.  Pay, obey with no veto power over EU decisions. This became worst deal than TM&#39;s deal and worst than stay in the EU.
Comment 78.1	@dakrontu that&#39;s why I said kind like Switzerland. UK will have to follow the EU rules and regulations without having a saying,  like Switzerland UK will be able to make deals with other countries and apply it&#39;s own tariffs,  but on the other side is that while Switzerland had already deals with the rest of the world and the association with the EU just help them to strengthen their position,  the UK doesn&#39;t have that. It has to start from scratch.
Comment 78.2	Switzerland is doing very well. Pity we are unable to emulate it. We are just not that successful. Their streets are clean. Their trains run on time. They cope with 3 languages. OTOH you are in trouble if you don&#39;t wash your car or put your bin out at the wrong time.
Comment79	The problem is neither side of the negotiations is addressing the elephant in the room. The British people do not want Brexit anymore.
Comment 79.1	dakrontu Yes they will....it&#39;s called a General Election!
Comment 79.2	Sadly they will never get the opportunity to express their revised opinion in a vote.
Comment 79.3	The Other Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Comment 79.4	@English Gentleman <br />That&#39;s it, can&#39;t deal with the facts so you stick your head in the sand and go to sleep.
Comment 79.5	The Other Zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Comment80	Barnier just loves it so it cannot be good for the United Kingdom!
Comment 80.1	"Forget Barnier Juncker Verhofstadt Tusk etc. They are here today, gone tomorrow. Faceless automatons.Just concentrate on the agreement itself. Which is … ?"
Comment81	I don&#39;t disagree with exiting the EU. I just wanted a deal to avoid tariffs. WHO rules on tariffs, subsidies and quotas are horrific. We have to survive the interim period with few trade deals. Serious deals with large players take years to negotiate. Also: we have not yet filed our WHO Schedules (reapplication), and any one unfriendly WTO country can veto those and blow us up on the launch pad. Likely suspects include Argentina, Russia, Zimbabwe, New Zealand, Australia and the US, for different reasons. Anyone who thinks this is going to end well has not been paying attention.

Comment 81.1	Ali Activ Plus - Tongkat Ali Most definitely, put not your trust in Uncle Sam! Ask Canada and Mexico how that one works out.
Comment82	DUP only want to deal with a hard border.
Comment83	Learn to spell and  be coherent zzzzzzz
Comment84	So this deal will force a general election at last, then we can get rid of the MPs that the majority of the public believe they no longer act in there interests,
Comment 84.1	none of them act in our interests, they are all the same regardless of which party they are in. wake up!
Comment 84.2	For fans of percentages, 37% of registered voters voted Leave.
Comment 84.3	@Kyle James Catterall well i voted leave found out about the lies now im a remainer i come to that conclusion after doing research
Comment 84.4	@Clem Alford clem i voted leave we were lied too by the hoity toity torys again im now voting remain and independence i would advise you to come back to scotland and live in what was voted to be 6th best place to live in the world......<br />SCOTLAND.
Comment 84.5	@Bojidar Martinov it&#39;s 48% not 49, and by your name not exactly an English national so interference with name calling won&#39;t change the results, we are aware many EU migrant&#39;s are apply for UK citizenship in the hope of a new refurendum, but if that route would be taken then every _all future votes<br />could/ would always be disputed which cannot be allowed to go down that route
Comment85	boris as sold the uk out there&#39;s no surprise there the dup hopefully will reject it no deal will do.
Comment86	haha junker just ruled out another extension, this should be fun! haha
Comment 86.1	@Neil Cheney Neil. You are right. OR, a Brexit party/Tories coalition
Comment 86.2	So either this deal or no deal or the rebels might want to cancel Brexit but this would only hand the Tory’s a massive election victory and finish off labour
Comment87	HSBC(Bankrupted bank) should be very happy now (they will just pay for Brexit,and avoid to pay USA) ....Thing is, now it will go again for briths parlament (and will fail to pass)AGAIN..(This is all USA plan to blow Europe like it was whit the refugee crisis)
Comment88	Congrats to uk .and i look forward to a deal between uk and the Americas like the old profitable days.
Comment 88.1	Dadson worldwide 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸🇬🇧🇺🇸
Comment89	PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.<br /><br /><br />The EU will NEVER make a good deal that will be passed by parliament.<br /><br />This is because they don&#39;t want the UK to leave the EU and are forcing the UK into a second referendum.<br /><br />The remainer MPs in parliament will stop any deals for the same reason.
Comment 89.1	"I do believe that it has been their plan all along to:1. Drag things out as long as possible, hoping for a change of government to one they can manipulate better.2. Only offer deals that are unacceptable.3. Concoct the requirement for a dowry of 60 billion Euros or whatever ridiculously big number they can come up with that is not so unbelievable that people realise they just made it up, and most important of all, NEVER tell us what the money is for (other than the obvious thing of taking us for a ride).4. Do the deals in stages like one-way trap-doors, ie invoke Article 50 before any talks can begin, then require a deal before any trade negotiations. At each stage, extract what they can, eg agreement to financial settlement, then more money and access to our fish stocks else no trade deal. Etc. Death by a thousand cuts."
Comment90	BoJo pretended to be Farage but he is Theresa May mark 2.
Comment91	What the BREXIT is going on?
Comment92	Ye Brits over on the mainland need some intelligent Protestants from Ulster to run yer country. Ye haven&#39;t a clue.
Comment 92.1	@laser325 Easee to see yer no loyal protestant or son of Ulster. The udf will take care of ye. Lenny Martin will take yer head off laddie.  Remember the Shankhill butchers. They haven&#39;t gone away.
Comment 92.2	From a man who doesn&#39;t know how to spell &#39;you&#39; and &#39;your&#39;.<br />Back to school laddie, you&#39;re not ready for political conversations.
Comment 92.3	@Chief Sunna of the Angles. a gang of them(uvf) turned up at a club i used to work on pulled their silly badges out and started proclaiming that they were the law...until they were shown to the seacat...you see a uvf badge in liverpool is like last weeks bus pass..useless and is more likely get you a free hospital meal instead.
Comment 92.4	@dakrontu No surrender, never, never, never.
Comment 92.5	That&#39;s a great joke.
Comment93	There needs to be an inquiry into the political bias of the senior management of the BBC
Comment 93.1	The BBC is the voice of the intellectual middle class of North West London. The people who dragged their feet and refused to move to Salford when the BBC tried to split its location to be more representative. So being from London, which is pro-EU, their views are predictable.
Comment94	Intensive work ! hahaha, three years later ! nothing intensive about it !
Comment95	Anything Boris agrees is crap because Bris is a chronic liar who only cares about his wig and his Eton&#39;s little friends
Comment 95.1	Out means  OUT
Comment 95.2	He wears a wig? I thought his hair was a symbolic representation of his neural network.
Comment96	After 3yrs of fleecing UK of billions .... 94%of UK businesses don&#39;t trade with the EU but are affected by the rules.... Taxes wasted they don&#39;t gain any benefits from... Public voted leave
Comment97	🇪🇺😎🍻
Comment98	*CONGRATULATIONS BORIS! GSTQ!
Comment99	Wonder if the British public will be allowed to know what is in the deal and how it will affect them ? As this a major constitutional change doesn&#39;t it need to be heavily scrutinized and amended if necessary ? We have been told the 17.4 million all wanted no deal and understood the consequences ? How will they feel ?
Comment 99.1	They did not understand the consequences. They were misled by an optimistic view which has not been borne out by events. The truth began to dawn as soon as the negotiations began.
Comment100	Free Assange
Comment 100.1	Like Snowden and Trump, Assange is a Russian asset.
Comment101	Well his just destroyed the Conservative party if that’s the case
Comment102	Barnier just knows this is all bs and this will never fly in Westminster. His relaxed attitude shows this. Just look at his little  pun he made when he replied he has experience with uk parliament not agreeing to any deal. This basically means Brexit is cancelled.  No-deal will never happen and parliament will never agree to one. By process of elimination this leaves remain as the only possible outcome.
Comment 102.1	Back to giving them hell in the EU parliament.
Comment103	Are you Brits that gullible as to think Blowhard Johnson, &quot;The Liar King&quot;, is actually bringing something new to the table??<br />The EU has no intentions of giving you your cake and letting you eat it, too! Face the facts:  1. You are blowing-off the EU and quitters do not get what they want.  2. Ms. May got the best deal you will get and there&#39;s not a thing you, nor Johnson, can do about it.
Comment104	DUP will succumb when the extra money ££££ promised to them by boris is increased. It&#39;s all smoke and mirrors.
Comment 104.1	@Sarah-Jayne Mcdonald I know all about bilderberg never seen any snp there
Comment 104.2	@Stoney Sloth I believe the outcome if all of this was pre planned before presenting it to the show of the media.<br />Probably discussed at a bilderburg meeting years ago.<br />Everyone plays their part. Some leaders work for their countries, other for themselves....most actually.
Comment 104.3	@dakrontu how do you know? Are you sitting in on meetings? This was all probably planned at last years bilderburg meeting or something. It&#39;s all a show. <br />Do the people ever get to see the details of the &#39;agreement&#39; we all supposedly are supposed to agree with??<br />Will it be published anywhere online? 🤔 Seriously....cos I&#39;d like to see what was so hard. It should be way more transparent.
Comment 104.4	@Sarah-Jayne Mcdonald its all a show explain?
Comment 104.5	@Sarah-Jayne Mcdonald explain or you another that throws conspiracys about without proof
Comment105	Brexit in name only. <br />Another betrayal by the establishment.
Comment 105.1	Robert Kelly remoaners that don’t accept democracy are the reason we STILL haven’t left. <br />1200 days and counting!!!!!
Comment 105.2	Brexiteer politicians got you into this mess🇪🇺
Comment 105.3	That&#39;s why EU have accepted it, it&#39;s worse than Theresa May deal, <br />But it&#39;s this or no deal as Boris will win the election because he is more Farage than Farage.
Comment106	xDDDDDDDDDDDDDD
Comment107	Hahahaha B.J submitted hhaaaha Love from EU
Comment108	Why are you delate the previous video about Hong Kong?
Comment109	TATA MOTORS SHARE PRICE  RISE IN STOCK MARKETS TODAY  was doubtfull  bec&#39;s we were not aware about political happennings on BREXIT  IN LONDON.<br /><br />SORRY  CAN&#39;T  DO ANY INVESTMENT  TILL  READ  EVERY THING CLEARLY.<br /><br />ITALIANS are busy in eating pizza then working on such important Event.
Comment110	The news about  BRITAIN &amp; EUROPE TRADE DEAL ON BREXIT  was knowingly kept  SECRET  BY INDIAN  INTERNET  RJIO on YOU TUBE.<br />And then when TATA MOTORS ORICES JUMPED I REALIZED  there may be some  news happenning in LONDON.<br /><br />LET US  NOW REVIEW OUR  NEW BUSINESS  STRATEGY.<br /><br />WILL  NOW NOT INVEST  IN HURRY IN ANY  BRITISH COMPANY FOR SOMETIME.<br /><br />Because we hv not got enough info to do our Homework on Investments keeping future course of Action .
Comment111	Boris has done what we thought our MP&#39;s were going to do all along and made a deal against what the people voted for! Now all we will hear is this was the best thing to do!!! Get rid of all our current MP&#39;s and only elect independent&#39;s who will do what the people want!
Comment 111.1	@English Gentleman that`s the misunderstanding from my view: Rules are necessary, only think about Airbus. As a politician I can work it out and offer preparations to those who vote. Or I keep it easy, so the voters believe it is easy... Now we see: It was never easy, and house of commons takes care of their people... who are impatient, disappointed, still expecting an easy cut as a solution. My opinion is, to stay in EU and negotiate, instead of creating chaos and negotiate then.
Comment 111.2	Clem Alford Yeah you can you’re about to leave lol
Comment 111.3	@JayJay5244 EU is just like the &#39;Hotel California&#39;. You can check in anytime you want but you can never leave.
Comment 111.4	Clem Alford I meant you as a country and nah fam my allegiance is to the United States. Although watching this Brexit thing unfold has been more entertaining than most Netflix shows lol
Comment 111.5	@JayJay5244 What the f--- are you on about. I have no power to change the political landscape I am just an observer like most of us that have no office in government. Maybe you do and if so get off your arse and do it.
Comment112	HMMMMMM   !!!J.C.   ------ GET LOST  DOUBT IF YOU WOULD HAVE GOT A     &quot; BETTER DEAL&quot;    !!  ITS BEEN A LONG THREE YEARS OF EXHAUSTED /    SLEEPLESS   NIGHTS    !!!FOR THE PEOPLE IN INVOLVED   !!AND WE THE PUBLIC HAVE BEEN SO VERY TIRED   !!WE ALL NEED A HOLIDAY     !!!!GOSH !   FORGOT THE CLIMATE CHANGE    !!CANNOT GO ANYWHERE      !!!I HOPE THIS IS FEASIBLE  ----- NEW BREXIT DEAL     !!!!LETS SEE WHAT HAPPENS ------ IN THE NEXT TWO YEARS     !!NO ONE CAN CHALLENGE THE ELITES      !!!!!FROM (U.K.)
Comment113	well the EU seem happy with it.
Comment 113.1	can&#39;t be good news then
Comment 113.2	@wHaDdA fOol maybe they&#39;re happy because they&#39;re finally done wasting resources on negotiations
Comment 113.3	They made the deal a shit one so that the remainer MPs will block it in parliament.
Comment 113.4	Thats the reason I think this has to be a bad deal for the UK. Time will tell.
Comment114	Bring back Guy Fawkes !!!!!!
Comment115	Funny that Swinson (the IL-Liberal Un-Democrats leader) and The Commissar have already come out and rejected this ‘deal’, before they even know the detail. Boris tried but any ‘Deal’ would have been rejected by this Remain Parliament. Those who claim they want to honour the Referendum but want a ‘deal’ are lying. They don’t want to leave under any circumstances.<br />Edit: Every time he’s says ‘democratic’ I shudder.
Comment116	With the reactions posted next to Barnier it is forseeable that there will be a hard brexit now. If this deal is worse than the one before from May, then hard Brexit may just be what B. Johnson intended to get anyways.
Comment 116.1	kinn grimm yep deal only benefits the EU, a rehash of a deal that has already been rejected previously,
Comment117	Corbyn is such a sore loser.  Can we have a new voice for Labour.  Hurts my ears just to hear him screech like nails scratching on the board.
Comment118	DUP unhappy, Barnier happy = grand stitch up! Disappointed that Boris has caved in to EU &amp;  thrown DUP under the bus 😬 I hope Arlene holds her nerve &amp; refuses this betrayal.  Bring on GE &amp; vote brexit party, Nigel Farage is right again about the Tories , it&#39;s all about saving their party at the cost of UK wide democracy!
Comment 118.1	Jammy Dodger Dodger agree, unless Boris has done this his only option of getting a general election since that has also been blocked, remainders would not allow no deal would not allow a GE and basically forced Boris&#39;s hand now they have a deal no one wants so the only thing to do now is to allow a general election of which the public can vote for the party they believe will get them the deal or no deal or revoke which ever stand point they wish
Comment119	So he got the deal, as stated. Now get us out on the 31st.
Comment120	After  all this time the EU finally decides to make an agreement . Why has it taken so long ? They did not want an agreement thinking the longer it dragged on the more likely Brexit would not happen .
Comment121	no deal is the only deal , never surrender ...bollocks to the EU ...
Comment 121.1	@kmn100 no u
Comment 121.2	You sound like one of those &quot;fleg&quot; muppets in Northern Ireland.
Comment122	i dont trust this
Comment 122.1	i agree. It`s a step back in slow motion. <br />For all of us. And some big global leaders just smile obout it.<br />Finally...
Comment123	1938: &#39;Peace for our time&#39; - Chamberlain

Comment124	Cancel your TV licence now
Comment 124.1	Should have did that a LONG time ago guys!
Comment 124.2	Lol
Comment125	There can&#39;t be any more of a better Brexit deal if this deal is rejected by Parliament expect to leave on NO DEAL!
Comment 125.1	No deal it is then
Comment126	We should leave with NO DEAL
Comment127	Parliament will prove its traitorous intent on Saturday, it&#39;ll get voted down. EU law will trump ( ignore the pun ) the &quot;Ben surrender act&quot; and the UK will leave without a deal on the 31st. OR parliament will go against democracy and simply withdraw  Article 50 wiping out parliament and the house of &quot;Lords&quot; in the process. Make or break time people. Remember, Remember....
Comment 127.1	@adscri the supreme court interfered with politics which courts should not do, the supreme judge is also very political, so not exactly an unbiased opinion or result, 🤔
Comment 127.2	The will of the people is expressed through parliament, duly chosen by election. Thus it can never be traitorous. The Supreme Court two weeks ago pointed out that a referendum can only ever be advisory, never binding.
Comment 127.3	gilkesisking they are now trying to halt Saturdays sitting
Comment128	The DUP is meaningless now, it really all depends on labour now.
Comment 128.1	"+Douglas ArthurYou are exactly right. Corbyn will destroy the country if it gets him to be PM. Corbyn is the problem. Always has been."
Comment 128.2	The Commissar will oppose it because he has used Brexit throughout to try to get his paws on the keys to No10. That is why Labour has been incomprehensible on Brexit.
Comment129	don&#39;t have subtitles?it is very rude when someone speaks to talk through it!
Comment 129.1	@Matthew Leonard I know cause I used to work in that industry, so I also know that you can delay it without any problem, translating computers work incredible fast today.  <br />And when this is to difficult, one can also decrease the sound level of the speaker. This is just amateurism and rude. I want to hear either the French or the English, not both together.
Comment 129.2	ybor20  because it’s live, they use an interpreter
Comment130	The DUP is meaningless now, it really all depends on labour now.
Comment131	Omg, God bless the EU. They actually stick up for us British expats. Unlike you guys on the island!
Comment 131.1	@English Gentleman lol, I don&#39;t answer some random guy&#39;s questions. You aren&#39;t worth an answer. Now, leave. Don&#39;t wait until 31 October
Comment 131.2	RealerSuperheld Well you didn&#39;t answer my first question but you did the second .....No you have nothing sensible to say!!!! If you don&#39;t like where you are.....YOU LEAVE!!
Comment 131.3	@English Gentleman you started talking bs. Now, leave
Comment 131.4	RealerSuperheld Any suggestions? Or do you have something sensible to say?
Comment 131.5	@English Gentleman go somewhere else
Comment132	Unfortunatelly, it&#39;s the worst thing the UK could do. EU, is the most important organization countries goals.
Comment133	Lot of pressure on the Dup now. But will this deal solve the problem? And of course will it get passed?
Comment 133.1	@Steven Austin Then scotland leaves✊
Comment 133.2	Since there will be no extension, parliament will be voting between deal brexit or no-deal brexit. <br />So, yes, it will pass.
Comment 133.3	No
Comment134	How can the protocol be revoked with a simple Majority in the NI Assembly?  Doesn&#39;t the GFA require a majority of both unionists and nationalists to pass any legislation?
Comment 134.1	The courts might throw the deal out.
Comment 134.2	Joanna Hammond that&#39;s the stale mate
Comment135	Ulster says no. No surrender, never, never, never. Our Arlene, our Nigel and our Sammy say no.
Comment136	Good luck UK....<br />I can’t wait to see in the next 5 to 10 years if “Brexit” was smart or stupid
Comment 136.1	English Gentleman I will judge it are the majority of average 4 and 5 figure yearly earners are happy and satisfied with their lives
Comment 136.2	Bilal Khalid agreed....it was an emotional not thought out reaction. 3 years of chaotic BS/entertaining drama.
Comment 136.3	Ian Lomas we’re going to find out...<br />If everything goes well, I’ll be around to see results in 10 to 15 years....god willing you’re right, because if you’re not....☹️📉 you will suffer for a long time.
Comment 136.4	meowmeow So you will only judge it on economic results?
Comment 136.5	Brexit was voted for.<br /><br />It must happen.
Comment137	Well ! I look forward to the new year with a glass of fizz &amp;&#39; a no deal 😘 thanks to dup, Labour,greens, SNP,lib-dems. Cheers 👍
Comment 137.1	Stoney Sloth , so we won’t be going our own way. You want to go cap in hand and beg the Europeans for money? Don’t you know what independent means?
Comment 137.2	"@Stoney Sloth Listen to people who have had experience trying to do that in the EU. Farage, Benn and many others. Look at the Brexit movie. That theme came up and these people trying to represent us could do f--- all.

Comment149	Blabla , Waste of time,  why go to Brussels and waste their time if it is not agreed here first in UK , it clearly looks Boris Brexiteers &amp; EU deal  .  It looks Theresa May games again
Comment 149.1	cannot bring a deal to the uk parliment until Boris discusses it with the EU first, as there was no deal up to that point, just possible talking points from both sides. A deal is an agreement on both sides. One side cannot dictate it.
Comment150	We’re now in the hands of the DUP
Comment 150.1	@Stoney Sloth Scotland didn&#39;t vote to remain, what are you talking about?
Comment 150.2	@D your French is bad.
Comment 150.3	Poo Tube - sorry?  Je ne parle français pas. 🙃
Comment 150.4	They have said no to the deal and scotland is outraged as they also voted remain
Comment151	If the EU like the deal, then it will obviously be a CRAP deal for UK ... Has Boris sold us down the river.... we will see !
Comment 151.1	@Barry Kelly Didn&#39;t the 17.4 million majority just vote to leave over 3.5 years ago? Maybe I  misconstrued the news.
Comment 151.2	@SassyBratt1 I won&#39;t. Just Leave with &#39;no deal&#39; which is a deal by definition!!
Comment 151.3	@laser325 How does that work? That&#39;s not leaving. You must be a remainer wanting to be a slave to the unelected appointed commissioners clique in Brussels.
Comment 151.4	As long as British people can keep their European passport and freely live and work in Europe, it&#39;s a good deal.
Comment 151.5	@SassyBratt1 Could well be. Don&#39;t know until we see what is written. Then if it&#39;s shit we can fuck Boris at the election.
Comment152	BORIS WE LOVE YOU!!!!!
Comment 152.1	@Jammy Dodger Dodger you have seen the deal? Link please, I am desperate to read it
Comment 152.2	Nah, it&#39;s rubbish, May&#39;s tricky treaty with lipstick on, still a dog&#39;s breakfast &amp; a sell out of UK sovereignty! It&#39;s just a deal to try &amp; save Tory party, a betrayal of NI. We need GE &amp; vote Brexit party! Nigel was right all along, he has been consistent so he deserves our confidence over this shower! Very disappointed with Boris 😫
Comment 152.3	@Stoney Sloth ok, maybe you can talk about something you haven&#39;t seen, but I can&#39;t. Admire your psychic abilities! Let&#39;s talk again when we&#39;ve read it, agreed? Then we&#39;ll both know what we&#39;re talking about 😁
Comment 152.4	@Stoney Sloth oh, what lies are they now?
Comment 152.5	@Gamer Cat 36 yet you love a guy thats a compulsive liar?
Comment153	Brexit deal is a consequence of Boris giving up on his promises no wonder Barnier is grinning
Comment154	Scotland will not be happy at this
Comment155	Boris will not be able to sell this fake deal as it happened with all previous fake deals.
Comment156	Standing with irland！fighting for freedom! Love from Hong Kong
Comment 156.1	@Jeffrey Burke I&#39;m not a Chinese troll but he is. A real HongKonger would never want bad for Britain. If he is from Hong Kong and wants bad for the UK, then he should remember pre-1997 where the British gave him freedoms that he will not enjoy anymore after they unite with China. <br />He is a Chinese troll who want us Brits to say that &quot;if they support Irish reunification, we&#39;d support Chinese reunification&quot;.  Good luck with that Chinese troll, we, the citizens of the UNITED Kingdom will never support an undemocratic and murderous government like China&#39;s and under no circumstance would we support the idea of murderous terrorists like the IRA.
Comment 156.2	@Lay King, never mind the idiots commenting on your spelling. The only thing you left out was an &quot;e&quot; in Ireland.
Comment 156.3	C M I’m confident Chinese people (including yourself) cannot spell it either.
Comment 156.4	Chinese troll.
Comment 156.5	Since when has Ireland been fighting?? LMAO
Comment157	excellente deal
Comment 157.1	But one straight banana &amp; get one free.
Comment 157.2	Explain what the deal is
Comment158	no british PM should cut up the union, this is a disgrace, of a deal
Comment 158.1	Well said

Comment 160.2	@Bilal Khalid Order: Listening, thinking, talking. Communication. House of Commons will do it, Sir. I am optimistic about an even better solution. But the procedure in between is necessary, as it happens.
Comment 160.3	@GermanGreetings <br /><br />What?
Comment 160.4	@Bilal Khalid Fault ? <br />If you feel dissatisfied... do you need `guilty` others, to explain life to yourself ?<br />Faults... you are funny. Faults entertain the world since 2 years, meanwhile Barnier and his team are waiting and Bercow tries to keep order...
Comment161	This is worse than theresa mays deal wtf BORIS YOUR A JOKE
Comment 161.1	PLEASE READ CAREFULLY.<br /><br /><br />The EU will NEVER make a good deal that will be passed by parliament.<br /><br />This is because they don&#39;t want the UK to leave the EU and are forcing the UK into a second referendum.<br /><br />The remainer MPs in parliament will stop any deals for the same reason.
Comment162	Boris Johnson already lost the DUP vote. Will he have enough numbers to get it through? Failing that, 2nd referendum.
Comment 162.1	DJVEGAS1000 🤪😂🤪😂experts, don’t make me laugh, there’s no such thing😂😂😂and your a fool to believe anyone who says they are😂😂😂
Comment 162.2	@Scottex1966 ur trying to simplify a very complex matter. the last 3 years have proved that. Also im pretty sure ur not a financial or economical expert or well researched on the union so im gonna believe the experts over a dreamer like u
Comment 162.3	DJVEGAS1000 rubbish you cannot predict the future and listening to doom mongers has been a plague of this country for the last three years , the worst thing that happened was to drag this out for this long to start with, should of left straight away it would all be done and dusted by now. So you see it was that simple.
Comment 162.4	@Scottex1966 its not as simple as that though is it. Trying to not fck the country up at the same time is prob a good thing to do after decades of eu membership
Comment 162.5	DJVEGAS1000 what brexiteers wanted was to leave the Eu three years ago.
Comment163	Thank god! Now we just need to get rid of Trump and then we can get back to work on important issues, instead of these two circuses.
Comment 163.1	This is literally just the beginning. Whats become distorted over the last 3 years due to the UKs rediculious amount of BS, dithering &amp; contrarianism is the fact this &quot;deal&quot; isent a deal its just the withdrawal agreement. If the UKgov. hadn&#39;t descended into 3 years of self absorbed navel gazing &amp; tantrum throwing, this WA should have been agreed within the first month of negotiations. Now its on to the actual trade negotiation. Which there is now 14 months to discuss. At which point if the UK hasent a WTO schedule sorted(which it probably wont, Russia took 17 years to gain approval after USSR fell &amp; could trade on the old out of date one which the UK cant after the transition period) means that it will take hit an economic wall hard after loosing access to 60 trade deals 749 other treaties. If it matches all of those(which it wont) &amp; gets a trade deal identical to EU membership(which it wont) then it breaks even.

Comment 165.4	Yh great ,  who in UK agreed with your Brexiteers dream deal,  there are already many mps opposing it just like the old boris, mps who are waiting to vote against it, just as old mp boris did it to May. Learn from your repeating mistakes first,  agree with each other first here in UK then go to Brussels to challenge and to get a good agreement . Mps have under this PM even 1 day to study and next day expected to vote,  while Theresa May gave time to mps to study the agreement, Boris is a joke
Comment166	So Boris has achieved something in a couple of months that treacherous May failed to do in over two and a half years !!!! .. says it all 🇬🇧
Comment 166.1	That&#39;s cuz he writes for the Telegraph.
Comment 166.2	Oh yes. It also must meet with the approval of the terrorist organisation DUP/UDA who Boris gov. is beholden to.
Comment 166.3	Nothing is &quot;achieved&quot; until this passes 28 members parliaments and EUparl.
Comment 166.4	Matt Whelan — Yep .. and no doubt we’ll see corbyn and his racist party block whatever deal is put to them because they’re anti-Britain .. 🇬🇧
