Comment1	I&#39;ve got shed loads of cotton bags, so I&#39;ll keep using them! Another thing one could do is use old clothes and make your own bags from those! OK they may not be trendy, but it&#39;s recycling the clothes!
Comment2	jacques ?
Comment3	I don&#39;t believe plastic pollution is a problem the animals wild up to it or eat it don&#39;t care about it throw it in the ocean and feel good about it
Comment4	Wise use of a boon is the only option, not to curse plastic.
Comment5	Sten Gustaf Thulin: I invented the plastic bag to make the world a better place.<br />Humans: Didn&#39;t take our laziness and stupidity into account, huh?
Comment6	Is there a reasin the bbc is totally ignoring the ep stein case?? What about Prince An drew?? Royal pea do? Why isn&#39;t the bbc covering this?? Are you still covering up for pea dos like you did in the days of Jimmy sa vile?<br />BBC = pea do protection
Comment7	A reusable bag must be used at least 131 times? Jeez in Hawaii that’s all we use for the 388383488548 days of our lives
Comment8	bbc you did not do enough to make plastic help the planet
Comment9	Plastic is not problem but throwing habit of people  is problem.<br /><br />I written meaningful content and lyric in hindi, which will motivate people to  stop throwing habit of plastic and garbage.<br /><br />I need good team to give finishing touch of my content and prepare video messages and sponsor to launch my campaign.<br /><br />I will launch songs, website, poster, slogan, video messages, music band, social media campaign.<br /><br />I also planned several new ideas which will address plastic and garbage problem.
Comment10	Yeah if only a plastic bag would last me 103 days..
Comment11	I propose that you should give a subtitile for all of your video please. It will be salutary for foriegn learners
Comment12	There are huge numbers of warehouses full of leftover fabrics. Why not just tap into the fabrics that already exist and make bags of them instead of making bags out of new fabric?
Comment13	The intension behind creating plastic could be for saving the trees but plastic bags are not something that just in question. The video advices to recycle plastic bags that solution is meaningless what about furniture, toys bottles, containers the list is endless what all to recycle? The use of paper has increased in many folds. People are wearing more of cotton clothes because every day the fashion is changing in this age of use and throw denims are a big necessity whether it is creating environment issues that nobody cares.  My point is plastic bag was invented and gave birth to much bigger monsters in various forms in order to make life easier but now it&#39;s become a major problem to tackle<br /><br /><br /><br /><br /> m
Comment14	Quit confused...
Comment15	They’re not.
Comment16	It ain’t the material, it be the user.
Comment17	I agree ☝️
Comment18	What??? After banning plastic bags in NZ, it turns out they&#39;re better than cotton/paper bags? Jeeze.
Comment19	BBC!!!! Why don&#39;t you like democracy?
Comment20	You forgot to mention the chemicals and pollutants contained in plastics which negatively affect humans, animals and plants alike.
Comment21	So thick plastic bags are the overall best thing to buy. Cheap, lightweight, arguably sturdier than cotton bag, easy to produce.
Comment22	Cotton bags are the best because they are strong so possible to use them many times but once they are damaged could be easily recycled in 100%
Comment23	People just like to lie to themselves, if there are no problems to be seen(paper degrades), then there is no problem(ignore the paper production and degradation damages to the environment). Why there are a lot of big corporations switch to more expensive paper bag you may ask, don&#39;t they know the paper bag is actually more polluted? Yes, of course they do, a big corporation their size will never do something without proper evaluations, they did it any way, to fool the &quot;environmentalists&quot; with some so called &quot;environmental friendly&quot; brand who doesn&#39;t even bother to do a research on google.
Comment24	Same old story. Environmentalists and activists doing things that are bad for the environment.
Comment25	Soory, but I don&#39;t believe in it. This is just publicity to help plastic bags producers. Neither plastic bags nor paper bags. One have to have its own bag to do shopping. It&#39;s despicable how people are manipulated for the Media and Business Corporations.Disgusting!
Comment26	It&#39;s hard to take environmentalists seriously when they won&#39;t allow you to put your food in plastic bags but they want you to buy three kinds of plastic bags to put your garbage in. Environmentalists also put disposable diapers on their children, go figure.
Comment27	Just make them biodegradable and voila.
Comment28	Hemp you idiots...
Comment29	Cancel your licence. No contact no fee.
Comment30	propaganda
Comment31	The bags and plastics don&#39;t do anything wrong.Are we the Humans throwing them out eveywhere the ones to blame🤔
Comment32	"UK is made up of 4 countries.<br /><br />1. England <br />2. British Occupied Scotland.<br />3. British Occupied Northern Ireland.<br />4. British Occupied Wales. <br /><br />N d talk about Kashmir which is n will always b rightly ours. <br /><br />Educate this to others. Let dem know what type of hyppo we are dealing with."
Comment33	Remember the 5 &#39;R&#39;s<br />-Refuse<br />-Reduce<br />-Reuse<br />-Repurpose and<br />-Recycle
Comment34	It&#39;s our disposable society.
Comment35	And now our shopping is delivered in dirty baskets thanks to these idiots.
Comment36	Yeah...What you need to do is report on growing violence by Asian gangs against whites. For example, A teenage tree surgeon had his hand chopped off with an axe in an ‘appalling’ attack carried out by an armed mob sparked by a road rage row in Rochdale, a court heard.<br /><br />The victim, then aged just 18, was one of four workmates set upon on Church Road, Newbold, on the afternoon of October 17, 2017 by a gang of up to 20 men.<br /><br />They had been summoned by Habibur Rahman, 27, who called the victims ‘white b******s’ who were in his ‘country’, Minshull Street Crown Court heard.<br /><br />Some reporting on these crimes would be in the BBC licence payers interest, I believe.
Comment37	BBC news support plastic
Comment38	I use em for trash bags. They are never wasted in my house. Trash bags are expensive. Im a Single Mom. I dont use a whole bag before it needs dumped. Trash goes out daily. I havent had a trash bag in my trash can for months 😊
Comment39	Nic info.
Comment40	"<a href=""https://creativeswan.blogspot.com/?m=1"">https://creativeswan.blogspot.com/?m=1</a>"
Comment41	Banning plastic shopping bags and straws, Styrofoam and beef is total foolishness. The fact is that this is merely a part<br />of the liberal’s ideas to implement Islamic rules through socialism all over the western world and especially to weaken the United State economic and military power and then to enrich the socialist governments to take control.<br /><br /><br />The point is that if we ban plastic than we must turn to paper and paper comes from trees, thus devastating our forests to create real climate problem for human beings, this is the trick of the devil through the liberals to help speed up the destruction of mankind.
Comment42	BBC you you don&#39;t care, you just make money from fake scare stories,
Comment43	"Truth about  Greta Thunberg<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNekvfBZMqU"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QNekvfBZMqU</a>"
Comment44	"Look<br /><a href=""https://youtu.be/kvoubldNhN8"">https://youtu.be/kvoubldNhN8</a>"
Comment45	In the US u they give u a bag if you buy anything it could be a KitKat
Comment46	That segment completely ignores the main problem of plastic bags: they are not bio degradable.  If they were, there would be no reason to avoid them.  They would be definitely better for the environment than paper or cotton, even if not recycled.<br />At home we reuse shopping plastic bags as liners to trash baskets and first-level trash containers (inside larger trash bags).  They should get incinerated with the trash, and would be just a tiny component of it; their tiny cost would be more than offset by their contribution to making trash disposal safer and cleaner.  That would remain true even is trash were buried in landfills.  <br />The plastic bags are an environmental problem only because many are discarded straight into the natural environment. Since they are not biodegradable, and too light to be buried by natural processes, they just accumulate there.
Comment47	Don&#39;t cut trees.. Come again.
Comment48	Fi:ty years ago Governments  encourageed  plastic  culture to save Trees.
Comment49	The answer is just use Cloth bags. Just a find a Chinese or an Indian tailor in your vicinity, that is if there is, take your old clothes to them ask them to sew bags from it. That&#39;s it. Those bags last for years.  My grandmother has seven such bags and she has been using those for over a decade now.
Comment50	Estamos voltando a antigamente. No tempo de meus pais não havia sacolas plasticas, as compras eram colocadas em sacolas de papel ou de pano aqui no Brasil...é  sim eles já   estavam certos!😊
Comment51	there is no means to recycle plastic or up-cycled plastic bags
Comment52	In the USA many Corporation Food Stores have had States pass Laws banning plastic bags . Now those Store  chains Sell Paper Bags to their customers , and require they have some means to transport their purchases from the stores to the customers home. The average cost of 1 bag is $2.00 to $3.00 dollars each. I have been Reusing paper bags [and plastic bags ] for as long as they would hold up . And as we all have experienced plastic bags were re-designed for 1 time use.
Comment53	Let&#39;s make HEMP BAGS and support Cannibis Growers United 🙆‍♂️
Comment54	The people are lazy <br /><br /><br /><br /><br />(global warming / pollution in a nutshell)
Comment 54.1	People are stupid.  See above comment.
Comment 54.2	@enigma <br />So show me it, you say it exists and you believe in it so obviously you must have seen it all, surely you are rational and logical and made you mind up after you seen all of the facts and evidence and studies and experiments that is required to come to a conclusion? Show me the science and show me the scientists explaining the science. You haven&#39;t seen any of it have you? You have seen words and pictures that are backed up by no evidence. The climate has been changing since b4 humans were a thing, plus if we died every time you nutcases claimed there was a &quot;climate crisis&quot; then we wouldn&#39;t be here right?.... Why should any1 believe you when it turned out you were all full of shit every other time you made this claim? We died in the 2000s remember? Ask your parents about the 1 they died in in the 70s and ask them if their parents ever told them about the &quot;climate crisis&quot; they died to in the 20s and then get back to me on that along with the evidence and &quot;science&quot; and your &quot;scientists&quot; explaining &quot;climate science&quot; and i will believe you, deal?
Comment 54.3	All you have to look at is pictures of glaciers from before and after, and see how much they have receded. As for scientific evidence, there is loads, ice core analysis gives accurate historical temperature snapshots chronologically and they have clearly shown post industrial revolution that the Earth has been warming. I assume you get all your “facts” from pseudo scientists on the internet.
Comment 54.4	So do YOU have any proof of &quot;global warming&quot;? Why has the polar bear numbers risen????? Where are your &quot;scientists&quot; explaining this science to us? We would quite like to hear from these secret scientists to learn about their secret &quot;climate science work&quot;...
Comment55	Or stop PRODUCING them, and then people will have to carry everything, and then you&#39;ll miss that PLASTIC bag you threw away.
Comment56	Great should wear one around her head
Comment57	Imagine returning to the store with your plastic bags lol
Comment 57.1	Lots of decent decent people do. I have my rucksack which i keep with me, but if i get caught short and im at a mates house or whatever, chances are they will have one of those &quot;King bags&quot; full of hundreds of normal bags, so i pinch one of those and take it to the shop -  no one ever looks at me weird for that. they do look at me weird tho when i have all my veg sprawled out on the conveyor belt, 10 separate potatoes, 5 apples, courgettes aubergines tomatoes, some times they ask what am i doing i say i&#39;ve used my plastic &quot;budget&quot; for the day - they seem to understand that
Comment 57.2	That&#39;s what most people do here in Portugal every day. What&#39;s so laughable about it?
Comment 57.3	It’s not strange at all, your mindset is strange though.
Comment58	"Keep using your deadly bacteria lined bags you fools. While I carry on using my clean low carbon plastic bags, which helps prevent the world from turning into a fireball within the next 10 years. <br /><br />It really makes me feel so smug and virtuous in knowing that I&#39;m a better human being than the rest of you evil carbon polluters 😇"
Comment 58.1	If that’s the thing on earth that’s makes you feel smug and virtuous 👌 <br /><br />Great for you
Comment59	I thought this was a documentary about tarts in pvc dresses
Comment60	What about jute bags
Comment61	It was a better option over the depleted uranium bags or the cast iron bags or the bags under my eyes
Comment62	You know once i had expirience to clean wood from litter and met some fear picture: plastic botl was inside tree. I and my collegues cant get it from tree :(
Comment63	I still prefer plastic bags. Paper bags break easily, aren&#39;t waterproof and reusable bags have hygiene issues.
Comment64	If you want recycle some plastic staffs you should imagine as fight as smell of recycling factory. It is not about human only, it is about all nature organism too.
Comment 64.1	There is no smell. I have no idea what you&#39;re talking about
Comment65	Not only plastic bags, I think we can use glasses botl istead plastic botl :)
Comment 65.1	Ольга Зоренко glas has high production cost and break’s easily so we wont use it
Comment66	So it&#39;s not plastic that&#39;s the problem, it&#39;s just the way we use it.
Comment67	plastic bags are not bad they just need to be re-used.
Comment68	Everything has got to go somewhere. Plastic bags are made from bi-products of the oil industry. If it wasn&#39;t used for that it would have to be used for something else with similar ramifications or disposed of somehow. The fault is not with plastic bags but the thoughtless habits of people. Ban plastic? Remember when Greenpeace wanted to ban the element &quot;Chlorine&quot;? Ignorant knee-jerks will get us nowhere however useful politicians find them.

Comment70	Oil won&#39;t last forever and neither will plastic &amp; then we&#39;ll be screwed
Comment 70.1	danielmoore928 no I don’t agree there are many alternative’s
Comment71	I always dump bags that were used once. I have different ones all the time lol. Why should I be using it again? This is my personal choice
Comment 71.1	Continue to not look outside your little box, like the rest of humanity, as we zombie walk into the unknown. Name a worse combo: human + no education.
Comment72	We&#39;ve had a product for years... Hemp.
Comment73	Plastic bags are supposed to biodegrade after a while, but something tells me only our country and a few smaller ones uses them.   If it&#39;s only the West being coerced into doing conservation what is the point?  China alone will make more of a mess than the whole of Europe!  Plus they eat tiger penis!
Comment74	You&#39;re missing the point BBC. <br /><br />Yes, fabric bags require more energy to produce. That&#39;s not the issue though. We can produce green energy and will become more and more green energy based over time. The plastic however will continue to break down and pollute, and then build up into the food chain and environment.

Comment76	Does nobody remember string bags? Light, compact, strong.
Comment 76.1	Tony Blakeney I’ve got one full of plastic bags.
Comment77	Why trees, use hemp....  all sorted
Comment78	I am confused🙄🤔👼
Comment79	Recycle it? That&#39;s another fallacy. Lately we found out those items we put into the recycle bins? Most of them ended up in landfills
Comment 79.1	Filipe Saramago 🇸🇴
Comment 79.2	You must live in a very third world place then
Comment 79.3	Yep, those bins are just there to make people feel good about themselves. Where I work the recycling and the garbage ends up in the same compactor. Makes you think what&#39;s the point.

Comment82	Should have maybe released this video BEFORE all the plastic straw propaganda and ban.<br />Executing good intentions doesn&#39;t mean shit if they&#39;re not based on reality!
Comment83	Ummmmmmm...... DERP!
Comment84	It&#39;s not about the material, it&#39;s about how it&#39;s used.<br />Single use is the key word there. Every non consumable single use thing we make becomes a problem. It&#39;s not only plastic bag, it&#39;s also stuff like fast fashion, electronics, wrapping materials, among several other stuff.<br /><br />Of course, there are materials that are more recyclable than others, more biodegradable than others, less toxic for the environment than others, so it all goes into the mix.<br />But in general, the more stuff lasts, and the less things become garbage, the better. Unfortunately, we ended up in a culture that goes exactly against that. Nothing is built to last anymore. For rich people, fast fashion and electronics that are getting close to a yearly upgrade cycle are the norm. For poor people, it&#39;s all extremely low grade stuff that will break down one way or another super fast.
Comment85	have you ever use these plastic bags, they break very easily.
Comment86	Dear BBC News,<br />Thank you for posting.<br />I reuse our plastic bags for trash cans. ♻️<br /><b>Far</b> too many landfills where I reside, they cover them up with sod and our drinking water is ruined. 😢😪<br />I call them &quot;Landfill Hill&quot;<br />Singing: 🎼🎤🎶🎵<br />&quot;Sliding down on Landfill Hill.<br />&quot;I can&#39;t see the city lights..&quot;<br />&quot;I did not believe this information.&quot;<br />&quot;Should we trust incineration?&quot;<br />&quot;Son, unpack you&#39;re bags, I think we&#39;re staying home&quot;<br />🙄<br />Originally sung by <br />Mr. Peter Gabriel entitled: &quot;Solisbury Hill&quot;<br />Love from 💕<br />Under a &quot;Flat Rock&quot;<br />Mish Again<br />USA 🇺🇸<br />Peace 🌿🕊
Comment87	BBC loves, bbc.<br />I see you&#39;ve past new laws in Terrible Britain that make speech more troublesome than burglary. So.....phags like you can ride the hershey highway....bah bah bah........chicks with dix, are and will always be men.....bah bah bah......oh yes indeed, men with teets will forever be in the need......bah bah bah.
Comment88	Yea, your father created an even bigger problem for the environment, mate, I live in a less developed country- and there no recycling plants or any other way to get rid of this nuisance. Plastics are choking plants and domestic animals, such as goats and cows, are eating &#39;em. Thanks to your dad.
Comment89	I LOVE &quot;BBCNEWS&quot;~♡
Comment90	Plastic bags are to flimsy these days. I use denim bag that my mom made years ago for picking appels
Comment91	Thing is single use anything is bad. Just reuse whatever you got, and cotton or resuable bags. They should ban single use paper bags as well.
Comment92	Wow
Comment93	Should have made those <br />Bags with gold see if people would still throw it casually.
Comment94	SAVE THE TURTLES SKSKSKSKS
Comment95	Video fails to address plastic bag use as trash bag
Comment96	Plastic bags, at least here in the US are not made for multiple use, you are lucky if they hold up the first time. They tear, and split most have holes in the seams before putting a single item in them. The manufacturers FORCED us to use plastic and now blame us for them being in landfills and blowing around the streets. Why isn&#39;t HEMP included in this article?
Comment97	Govmnts are supposed to help people build a better society too &lt;&lt;&lt; FREE ASSANGE
Comment98	Why no captions? 😔
Comment99	I only like the part where she said, &quot;use it again and again, and when it breaks, mend it!!!&quot;. Indeed that&#39;s the way to go.
Comment 99.1	@Kelli that&#39;s incredible!! Wonder why most of us doesn&#39;t think like that, all we ever think about is fancy stuff. That&#39;s why I always say, &quot;it&#39;s not what we drive, wear or sleep into that puts food on the table. It&#39;s the land we are busy destroying that makes the magic&quot;. No matter how rich one can be, he or she will never feed on the money they have in the reservoir but the produce that comes from the land. At the end of the day, the rich and the poor are just the same regardless.
Comment 99.2	@Mutofwe Mwila no.  I made them from scrap fabric I collected over time. I have made many over the years, from old jeans, and upholstery swatches. Only for myself and a few friends. My sewing isn&#39;t in my own opinion worthy of selling.
Comment 99.3	@Kelliare you selling those cotton bags?
Comment 99.4	@Kelli I think I missed two things, a letter and a word. The word is &quot;of&quot; between name and reforestation, check that out. However, I agree with you hundred percent.
Comment 99.5	@Mutofwe Mwila I think you missed a N in your comment &quot;a plastic bag can ever be mended&quot; <br />I agreed cotton is not a problem its biodegradable, sustainable and as with any crop must be watered, with the water returning to the natural underground Water table.<br />I use cotton/cloth bags some I have made myself
Comment100	Pick on China.
Comment101	Escucha bbc decir la verdad como terminar con las guerras no es locura locura es dejar que continue
Comment102	Subtítulos por favor...
Comment103	Send a man to paradise and he will teach the people there to lie and be mean.
Comment104	This is absolute nonsense. As long as you replant the trees you are using a renewable resource. Nature is all about growing and dying and growing and dying...
Comment 104.1	The problem is not deforestation but the huge amounts of water and electricity used
Comment105	Choosing between just &quot;single-use&quot; plastic bags and paper/cotton reusable bags is a false dichotomy! There are plenty of durable plastic options. I use ripstop nylon bags myself. I also think if the plastic bags companies have been giving away for decades (and now sell) were made of slightly thicker material more of them would have been reused. I&#39;d wager good money that the bags of today are markedly thinner than the original invention.
Comment106	Those that have consumed the most shouldn&#39;t get away with blaming ALL humans.
Comment 106.1	H Kay jup we schould blame each human separately
Comment107	Poor people been doing that long time ago till now, they just use what the rich peoples left over, used items, poor people basically repurposing all the items rich used.  so tell that to the middle class and rich people because they are the group of people whos damaging the earth.
Comment 107.1	Yes
Comment108	If you make a trash you will be a trash 😐
Comment 108.1	Just live in your trash.
Comment109	Does your council recycle plastic bags coz mine sure doesn&#39;t. 🤬<br />And you wonder why people are protesting out government over it&#39;s complete failure to look after our environment.<br />They can&#39;t even get the trivial basics done. What chance is there that they can get us off our carbon addiction in a hurry?!
Comment110	Hey, I have an idea,  why don&#39;t you just shove all your stuff up your ass and carry it around and I will keep using bags?
Comment111	I thought you where going to say they can help the world if they where put over bad peoples heads . 🤷‍♂️
Comment112	Like straws, plastic bags are a convenient scapegoat to distract from the MUCH bigger crisis of climate. <br />So sure, try to stop using plastic, but that won&#39;t stop the environmental catastrophe underway. That will take much bigger changes.<br />But we can make those changes, IF we accept they have to happen and demand that our governments make them happen 👍🌍🌱
Comment 112.1	"NathansHVAC <br />Strawman much?<br />I don&#39;t want socialism. I want a properly regulated market economy. That means making destructive industries pay for the damage they do. It&#39;s called regulating externalised cost.<br />What an insane idea huh? <br /><br />When it comes to fossil fuels, the damage is in the trillions of dollars, every year.<br /><br />I&#39;m not big on huge public subsidies for destructive, corrupt and massively profitable industries.<br /><br /><a href=""https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/02/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509"">https://www.imf.org/en/Publications/WP/Issues/2019/05/02/Global-Fossil-Fuel-Subsidies-Remain-Large-An-Update-Based-on-Country-Level-Estimates-46509</a><br /><br />Maybe you can tell me why you are."
Comment 112.2	Why is the only solution socialism where every one is a slave?
Comment113	Plastics are good in some instances: like in cars.
Comment114	Plastic has become the scapegoat for our laziness.
Comment115	The problem isn&#39;t so much the material, but the fact that we keep treating <b>everything</b> disposable. ♻️
Comment116	Yeah, you can do better, but good luck getting the hoardes of the 3rd world to listen to you.
Comment117	Greed and laziness are the main culprits. Humans are too dumb or ignorant to actually give a fuck about their motherland. Oh, white folks that is. Most countries contribute little to climate change, while a small set of rich fucks take a dump collectively on the planet, and everyone else has to clean up their mess.
Comment118	The only problem is on how people use the plastic bags and throw it anywhere they like. The world’s laziness is the problem

Comment 125.2	@cp1307 Because horses don&#39;t run on solar and wind energy. They need to eat and drink a lot and it will take years for a newborn horse to become big and strong enough to pull a cart. So horse carriages are extremely energy-inefficient.
Comment 125.3	@cp1307 because of the poop and all.
Comment 125.4	Who said horsecart are not eco friendly
Comment126	At the end of the day The Government need to stop Ranting on about shit like this...  The Government still Use and process plastics to distribute.... Why keep telling us how to dispose of certain materials when they won&#39;t stop producing them!! 👌🏽👌🏽.....
Comment127	We all need to use the same plastic bag repeatedly to save our planet, but it always broken after I used it for the first time.
Comment128	See the talk of how much water the cow drink or cotton take to save the earth is hypocrisy same people  who support government export deaths weapons to destroy earth and kill  thousands thousand peoples  , it&#39;s  easy if we collect the plastic melt what we can&#39;t reuse and  store them back in deep earth
Comment129	Brought to you by Shell.
Comment 129.1	@A DIFFERENT RID Bullshit, it was just the history of why the plastic bag was invented: to be reused.
Comment 129.2	AWResistance Practically an advertisement for oil drilling. So yeah.... SHELL 👍😴
Comment 129.3	The history of the plastic bag was brought to us by Shell?
Comment130	bullshit
Comment131	That&#39;s the key! To use OVER AND OVER again, not to use once and make more

Comment134	It&#39;s my first time when I realize <br /><b>BBC</b> tells on of work topic. 😅
Comment135	We actually have cotton bags we got in the 90&#39;s! And we still use them at the grocery store. Just wash them once or twice a year.
Comment 135.1	@BLT4LIFE infected with what?. I think you&#39;re being a bit too dramatic.  If you think like that then maybe you should wash your coat, your bags, your gloves every day just in case you infect an ill person with who knows what.  Maybe you should spray your shoes with disinfectant or clean all your money (technically the dirtiest thing you use) or how about the purse the money is in.  I mean you could literally go mad.   Where does it stop when you think like that.  Nothing dirty about a cotton bag that has contained wrapped food (pretty much everything) and possibly a coconut or something.  If I&#39;d got carrots that had dirt on them or something that made my bag dirty.  I&#39;d agree. But not with wrapped food and so on.
Comment 135.2	Another reason to wash your bags is consideration for other people. Maybe you&#39;re immune system is strong enough, but bringing infected bags to a public food supply really isn&#39;t wise.
Comment 135.3	@BLT4LIFE how often.  I do the same.  I never pop anything slimy or wet in them. All the food i buy is usually already wrapped.  Or it&#39;s like a cucumber.  Which isn&#39;t messy.  They don&#39;t need washing much.   Over washing is using unnecessary water and detergent.
Comment 135.4	Me too!. I just keep repairing them.
Comment 135.5	Please wash them more often than that if you put food in them. 🤢
Comment136	Please plant trees and stop cutting existing trees..... save earth from climate change
Comment137	Please save electricity and water usage and save earth from climate change
Comment138	Please save earth from climate change by conserving your energy consumption and walking and bicycling when possible....
Comment139	Please stop using plastic products and bags and plastic straws.... they pollute our land and water
Comment140	Water pollution is more of a serious issue than the nonsense of carbon taxes. I pay carbon taxes in a country that produces about 2% of world GHG and supposedly my lifestyle and culture ruined the earth. They then take some of that money from carbon taxes and give it to the UN or some other overseas place. Hopefully Justin Trudeau loses the election tomorrow and every other liberal and leftwinger in this country contracts ebola.
Comment141	Answer: &quot;Keep using the bag you already own.&quot;<br />...amazing init, we human beings must be the dumbest &#39;advanced&#39; species in the Universe! 😫
Comment 141.1	@Jen-Yueh Hu lol...😅
Comment 141.2	@Smurfette Did It Well I&#39;m sorry that USA make crappy plastic bags.  Maybe you should consider moving to another country where they actually make quality goods.
Comment 141.3	@Emma, live drink sleep Can you have a conversation without being abusive? Loser.
Comment142	How to destroy Earth:<br /><br />1.  Own a car<br />2.  Eat red meat<br />3.  Travel by plane<br />4.  Burn coal<br />5.  Buy plastic toys<br />6.  Cut down all trees<br />7.  Eat palm oil<br />8.  Pollute rivers<br />9.  Hunt endangered species<br />10. Use weed killer<br />11. Use pesticides<br />12. Have several children<br />13. Pander to atavistic religions
Comment 142.1	You are an evangelical leftist.
Comment143	Well done. Thanks for broadcasting. 📺 Poor human race...
Comment144	In Pakistan we banned plastic bags
Comment145	&quot;Recycle it&quot; when most of those bags are not made of plastic you can recycle,  or even worse,  when you can&#39;t recycle it (we don&#39;t have recycling program in Russia).
Comment 145.1	We ? where in Russia you from ? rofl
Comment 145.2	Wow, maybe you should create a recycling program then. Never would have imagined such a thing
Comment 145.3	@Galia R I&#39;m not against it but you can&#39;t take things away without giving an alternative we pay for our shopping and just want something to carry it in. Ie why are they breaking up all the cardboard boxes at the supermarket, can we not put our shopping in those ?
Comment 145.4	@Fonzie totally agree! That doesn&#39;t mean though that the recycling itself is a bad idea if its realisation is lame.
Comment 145.5	In the UK we sort our rubbish and the council comes along and throws it all in the same lorry anyway so whats the point ? its all just show to meet EU targets as they only have the facilities to recycle 10% of what we sort anyway.
Comment146	A plastic bag is still useful just put it over a XR members head to cover up the ugliness
Comment147	"Educate yourselves on climate change..    <a href=""https://youtu.be/NYoOcaqCzxo"">https://youtu.be/NYoOcaqCzxo</a>"
Comment148	And that what we call side effects.
Comment149	Plastic bags are absolutely necessary. Environmentally safe natural plastic alternatives exist. So start making them, and charge whatever necessary to the consumer.
Comment150	The right wing and neoliberal project that is Western capitalism has been the most destructive force on this planet. White people need to start acknowledging that it is their endless meddling, labour exploitation, waste dumping,war profiteering that is the problem. He natives of South America weren&#39;t burning the Amazon rainforest down. The natives of Australia weren&#39;t destroying the Great Barrier Reef. The natives of North America and Africa weren&#39;t turning their lands into privately owned mining sites.<br /><br />The problem, unfortunately, is white people.
Comment 150.1	If living like a native is so great, why did all the natives move to the cities?   Also, why don&#39;t people from cities move to the jungles to live like natives.   Maybe, life is easier in cities?
Comment151	What about plastic wrapped food, especially a plastic wrapped set of individually wrapped in plastic items. That is not single use, you have to buy it every time you want to eat. We can use biodegradable materials, but they cost more in terms of money (and energy?) to make. It&#39;s not just plastic bags that are the problem.
Comment 151.1	@Nudore Forb 💙🙏
Comment 151.2	Hello from Iraq 🇮🇶, wonderful station BBC - and all the honorable people in the world we in Iraq rely on your presence in the revolution of Baghdad 25/10 to cover the Iraqi revolution against financial corruption and Iranian interference .. The Internet will be cut off and the internal media will be blacked out so please convey our message to the world  We want a new system that governs Iraq, not religious, gives freedom to all. We are waiting for you.
Comment152	Well maybe if the government remembered in 1533 it used to be law that if you had a farm you were required to grow hemp BECAUSE IT IS USEFUL. It is easy to grow, fast to cultivate and you can make bags that would last a lifetime.<br /><br />But nooooo, the &quot;deadly&quot; cannabis plant is related to hemp so we must regulate and control it, god forbid anyone uses anything but oil. 🤨

Comment172	But British are the most hated people on the planet<br />They are thieves and Invaders .. ridiculous
Comment 172.1	@Nick D that&#39;s my point dummy. Aztecs conquered and ripped organs out of people they conquered. Muslim empires had slaves from africa and castrated them so they could not breed but we only ever here about the ebil whiteys who had the blacks slaves. World&#39;s a joke. It deserves to burn.
Comment 172.2	@The BadderMan what about the ottoman empire? I know the british empire influenced your country in some way, my country has been severely influenced by the ottomans and were enslaved for 400 years. The fact that you have only one empire in your head as being colonialist is ridiculous. Even the definition of genocide was made to describe the acts of the ottoman empire upon the armenians, greeks and assyrians

Comment173	Put it on your head real tight,that will do.
Comment174	The irony lol xD
Comment175	I have reused my bags for garbage and yard waste and to haul sand from the quarry. They have been useful for I have always reused them and have been thankful for these free bags through the years.
Comment176	Nope plastic bags got made cheaper and cheaper over the years so 1 use and they would rip or handles fall off and then they charge 5p for bags that rip or fall apart bags shouldnt brake like this so people got sick of it not lazy 5p be came the normal and it was easier for people to bin the broken bags and keep good ones for next time  that is the reason people cant reuse them all and now its a big mess because the design of the bags over the years have been useless everything was made stronger in the old days that bags could be reused :) but its to late now our generation has got used to this way of life of cheaper the better throw away because weve been forced to live like this we are not lazy the big companies have gone lazy and scrapping every profit they can on anything they can hence cheap and nasty bags that we must use when we go shopping :) dont call us lazy see the bigger picture
Comment177	Mend a plastic bag?  😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂
Comment178	The solution is to recycle,  and to burn them.  Plants breath CO2 and hence give oxygen. More CO2, more plants,  more oxygen. NASA satellites shows world is greener now because of extra CO2. Burning bags is better than in the sea that decays over many years.
Comment 178.1	​@Pete C The toxic gas produced by plastic I mentioned was not CO2, Burning plastic releases more than just CO2, it also releases hydrochloric acid, sulfur dioxide, and dioxins just to name a few.
Comment 178.2	@MX Yes that make up you call toxic is  CO2. And I am not saying individuals burn plastic bags,  but gov waste burning instead of landfill that sometimes leeches into the oceans,  because they have decent smoke filters. <br /><br />To combat pollution everyone should plant one tree every week. I&#39;m doing this every weekend. How about you?
Comment 178.3	Burning the plastic would solve nothing if trees are constantly getting cut down. Even if there are still any plants around, plastic still emits toxic fumes when they are burned.
Comment179	Watch Frankenskies the Movie on YT to find the cause for Climate Change.
Comment180	If cotton/canvas bags are environmentally unfriendly, then try hemp bc it&#39;s cheaper to grow and sturdier than plastic. I keep a nylon bag in my purse that I&#39;ve used for 10 years, and a trolley for bigger hauls.🎈
Comment 180.1	Samuel Carrington is there is reason you can’t spell? The BBC is superb
Comment 180.2	Is there a resin the bbc is totally ignoring the ep stein case?? What about Prince An drew?? Royal pea do? Why isn&#39;t the bbc covering this?? Are you still covering up for pea dos like you did in the days of Jimmy sa vile?<br />BBC = pea do protection
Comment 180.3	@Nudore Forb Do not rely on the BBC rofl
Comment 180.4	Dirty old bag
Comment 180.5	That&#39;s great
Comment181	Finally some common sense.  The main problem with plastic bags is when people do not dispose of them properly.  They do not occupy much space in landfills, and recycling or burying them is probably the best way to dispose of them.  Biodegradable bags are a terrible idea because you are releasing toxins into the environment.  About solid wast dumps, people forget they are part of a cycle such that abandoned or non-economic quarries are turned into solid waste dumps.  Well engineered dumps have systems to collect and treat leachate and vent or burn off methane.  When dumps are filled, they are typically turned into parks.  Many beloved urban parks began as quarries, then were solid waste dumps before being turned into parks.
Comment 181.1	I shit in mine and put them through left wingers letterboxes.
Comment182	as usual the problem is not the invention, but the capitalism making the invention weaker to sell more of it
Comment 182.1	Riki <br />You have missed the point.<br />The reason why plastics manufacturers make flimsy disposable bags is because they can sell more that way.<br />But they pay none of the knock-on costs of selling those bags after they have been used. Nor do they pay the externalised costs of their manufacturing like the pollution they create or the carbon they emit.<br />If they did pay those costs, their disposable bags would cost MUCH more and so the disposable model would not work and we would use a sustainable model instead.<br />Economics see.<br />And this model flourishes under a highly capitalist system because money buys influence and companies use that influence to avoid proper regulation. So the destruction continues despite the damage it does to everyone else.
Comment 182.2	Yes because only people in capitalistic societies are lazy.
Comment 182.3	Monkeybear T <br />Depressingly familiar isn&#39;t it...

Comment 184.2	🙌🙌🙌
Comment185	El infierno está lleno de buenas intenciones. Nadie se detuvo a pensar que el remedio el plástico es peor que la enfermedad el cristal y papel que se usaba antes. O sea, que el consumerismo y el empaque excesivo de las cosas nos está ahogando a todo lo que vive en este planeta. Me parece al fin de cuestas que el ser humano debería de desaparecer de este planeta porque el planeta no nos necesita pero nosotros sí necesitamos del planeta para vivir.
Comment186	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DQW5w9yAWgE&amp;t=2m36s"">2:36</a> But...that is the point of a cotton bag...to be used over and over and over and over and over again. Most people would get that sort of use out of a cotton bag in just one year. You also just said that plastic bags get recycled. Are you high? They CAN get recycled and you can hand them in at large supermarkets but not all of us live near or go to large supermarkets. My local Tesco Metro certainly doesn&#39;t recycle them for example. You also can&#39;t put them in our communal plastic or mixed recycling bins because they will apparently break the sorting machines. <br />If you intended to confuse and obfuscate with this piece, well done, you did it."
Comment187	The final answer is using recycling bags.
