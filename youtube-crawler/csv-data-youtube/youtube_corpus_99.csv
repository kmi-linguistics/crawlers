Although he were trying to speak with an academic english accent, he remains an american citizen and is actually a lobbyist for making UK the 53nd american state .

Comment19	Listen to this British Brainwashing Corporation interviewer trying to set policy rather than simply ask questions. She doesn&#39;t like the answers because they don&#39;t fit the agenda of her globalist puppet masters. She&#39;s just another BBC &quot;but, but but&quot; butt head!
Comment20	I live in N.Ireland, {No wise jokes please}<br />I&#39;ve been watching high-street retail stores come and go for month&#39;s as businesses don&#39;t know what direction to take. Between that and the dissident IRA planting bombs along the Irish border.<br />The older generation here such as myself understand how dangerous this EU nonsense is for Ireland / N.Ireland, young ones just carry on thinking it won&#39;t effect them. In the not knowing what the 70&#39;s/80&#39;s was like. Besides some good pop-music and fantastic number ones, bomb scares, killings, punishment shootings, British Army patrols.. Etc

Comment44	Boris, your &quot;Excellent New Deal&quot; is not Brexit. You have failed your promise to get us out with or without a deal by Oct.31st and you are kicking the can down the road. When an election comes, you will be kicking the bucket.  Me, my family and all my friends will be voting for The Brexit Party so we will have a &quot;Proper Clean Break Brexit&quot;. I gave you a chance for my vote and you blew it.

Comment53	&quot;You&#39;re blackmailing parliament with the threat of a General Election...&quot;  Can she not see how rediculous that sounds?  Usually the one thing that opposition parties want is an election!  She&#39;s admitting that many of the remainers know they&#39;d be wiped out - and therefore that the people don&#39;t want many of the remainer MP&#39;s there.  It&#39;s called &quot;Democracy&quot; Laura.
Comment54	They want to scrutinise it because BJ has proved to be a puppet and corrupt in his dealings

Comment 57.1	So when BREXIT MPS are interviewed by BBC journalists does  Wayne Tyson want the journalist not to ask a question, because it might look like bias, Sorry the BBC is there to report the news  whatever the news story is about and  ask questions, the day that does not happen will be sad day.
Comment 57.2	Stfu and leave..  You sick of this,! Sick of that!. Everyone is sick of you lot.<br />Voting for Brexit is the equivalent to taking out a Mortgage, then giving you the interest rate, terms and conditions after you&#39;ve signed for it. Only a complete moron would do something like that🤔🙄.
Comment58	The best thing about brexit is watching miserable, depressing, self entitled, Marxists melt down every single day. 👌
Comment 58.1	Previous month I was able to pull my first five figure paycheck ever!!! I&#39;ve been working for this company over the internet for 2 years now and I never been happier... They are paying me $95 per hour, and the best thing regarding it is the fact that I am not that tech-savvy, they only asked for basic idea of internet and general typing skill...Amazing thing about this is that I have more free time with my kids. I am able to spend quality time with my friends and family and take care of my babies and also going on family holiday along with them very consistently. Don&#39;t avoid this chance and try to respond rapidly. Check it out, what I do... <b>discuss84­.­c­o­m</b>

Comment 62.1	Capitilism and Globalism killed democracy before the start of WW1.<br />We are just tagging along with their show, making us believe we are making a difference, when the difference is made before we vote.<br />They didn&#39;t crash the world markets and German banks for nothing.

Comment65	Your country is being sold down the river in front of your eyes.<br />You will never get BREXIT because the globalists won&#39;t let you have it.<br />Right now there are &#39;regional assemblies&#39; set up all around the place, deciging what is going to happen in YOUR local areas and you don&#39;t even know about it.<br />That isn&#39;t due to the EU but the United Nations and their Agenda 21.

Comment71	JC called it when he said Trump Brexit.<br /><br />Johnson is using the same tactics as Trump did when he took office:<br /><br />Purging of the republican party,<br /><br />Throwing chaos into the mix of congress,<br /><br />Challenging the supreme court.<br /><br />Making a mockery of democracy.<br /><br />Right wing populism.<br />Who said &quot;that sort of thing wouldn&#39;t happen here?!&quot;<br /><br />Well, fancy that?

Comment76	Leaving wouldn&#39;t be so bad if it wasn&#39;t  for in the process the Tories moving ALL the goalposts and regulations in a sledgehammer blow to the people.<br />Creating a US style shit hole economy based on the rich getting richer once more.
Comment77	tories must go now they are 2 years over due, there is usually a 10 year time zone and the tories are claiming squatters rights, let someone else abolish all your policies and spend a shit ton of money.
Comment78	Goodbye Labour Party hello brexit party
Comment79	Never mind Brexit, fit all trains with snow ploughs to scoop idiots off the tracks when they halt the network by jumping on the tracks........
Comment80	it&#39;s the same bill as before you said you would rather die in a gutter than have a extension
Comment81	What if I told you... all of this is just a prank bro?
Comment 81.1	Leehamster  I would believe you
Comment82	BOY the BBC is just as bad as the US news! Wow wow wow
Comment83	Boris Johnson is ignoring the legitimate responsibility of parliament to review and amend, where necessary, the proposed deal - he just wants to ram through a deal, regardless of glaring dangers that it contains. He’s trying to make labor look weak by not going along with him. He’s very loose with the truth.
Comment 83.1	last sentence . . .  that is an understatement
Comment84	if boris is voted out ! the uk could stay in the eu !  no need to break up a happy marriage !

Comment 86.1	Gabby Gershom Bassey correct <del>o</del> mundo
Comment87	Why do British people still sell people and organs?Why not let others comment!👎
Comment88	An election in UK would&#39;ve made more sense around February 6th than December 12th! An election close to Xmas time! Strange timing!
Comment89	It is simply disingenuous (a lie actually) to say that &quot;Parliament has approved the deal&quot; Parliament have merely agreed to pass the bill to a committee stage... AND AMEND IT.<br />THERE IS NO WAY they will PASS &quot;the deal&quot; as it is... no matter how long they are given to &quot;scrutinise&quot; it.<br />&quot;Get Brexit done&quot; is also disingenuous. The &quot;deal&quot; merely triggers a &quot;transition&quot; period. and many more years of negotiations.. not to mention 39 billion penalty and MORE to be levied on the whims of Brussels
Comment90	BBC is super fake news!
Comment 90.1	Sayfullo Shit<br />1 second ago<br />He&#39;s in trouble big time if he shits on us.

Comment92	Can’t he just skip the election &amp; find a ditch like he said he would do!
Comment93	So.... Boris Antoinette says let them snort cake.
Comment94	The mainstream media is still owned by the Zionist New World Order who want a one world government.  The last thing they want is Brexit.
Comment 94.1	Yeah, all those socialists/communists vying for the new world order are exclusively zionist, esp Xi - shut the fuck up
Comment95	again?, they make elections every 6 months. This primeminister is good.
Comment96	What a surprise - the phrasing of the questions by a BBC (remainer) reporter. The biased BBC. Well, BBC, you can have your TV license, but I am going to enjoy seeing you loose on Brexit!
Comment 96.1	@Public Public That is rhetoric - that is not fact. Prove to me that it is impossible for us to gain from Brexit. There are other countries out there to trade with. This obsession with the EU is childish.
Comment 96.2	everyone loses with brexit... except those who have invested millions in the pound crashing... oh and of course the million George Soros&#39; from all over the world waiting for the pound to fall and fail all those essential services which have been nicely fattened before selling them off. You brexiters are the real traitors.
Comment97	BOJO the clownish 🤡 tyrant, must be kicked out of his dictatorship, for a temporary/caretaker, PM, that can set up a people’s final say in what we the people want to happen. And if BOJO the clownish 🤡 tyrant, truly respected the wishes of the people, then he would be happy to ask us how we feel about it all..... But his bullshitting, is obvious to everyone with a mind, because he voted against this deal, when may presented it, and he also said that nobody in their right mind, would split the Union, with a border(that would mean that we would have to have our passports, to visit another part of the Union) between Ulster and the rest of the UK........ So if he gets his way, then it’s probably the death-knell of the UK, and the NHS too........

Comment101	Where the fuck is the monarchy ??? Where is their leadership ??? They are the highest office in the land. Where the fuck are they ?  <br />Britain is unable to govern itself. The best therefore is to dissolve the parliament, abolish monarchy and ask Brussels to send a governor to London.
Comment102	Question from america? We have fox news and and then we have msnbc. Which most here in America consider msnbc. &quot;fake news&quot; agenda driven to push a narrative . But not accurate truth to news. What is BBC and sky news in their perspective roles?? Thank you

Comment106	The British government informs.<br />Merkel and Tusk brought the EU to recession.<br />The German economy continues the recession in the III quarter.<br />The central bank of Germany warned that the country&#39;s economy may have contracted for the second quarter in a row, which means that the largest eurozone economy could have entered a recession for the first time in six years.<br />According to Vesti-Economics, the German economy in April-June fell by 0.1% in quarterly terms.<br /><br />“In the third quarter of 2019, the German economy could again contract slightly,” says the Bundesbank monthly report.
Comment 106.1	After brexit the grass will look a whole lot greener the other side of the channel.
Comment107	fuck off boris
Comment108	Yeah, vote for four more years of excuses, because that&#39;s all you will get from him and his party.
Comment 108.1	Nah, I&#39;m the least cup cake or snow flake on here.  Johnson isn&#39;t for Brexit, he was a plant.  Cameron and Clegg thought this one up a long time ago when they were in coalition Government.   The return of the two party system, those stupid enough to believe Johnson will vote con, those stupid enough to want a re-vote will vote Lib Dem.  No more hung Parliament, no more coalition Governments, no more low voter turn outs.
Comment 108.2	Go specsavers cupcake lib dems and labour is a joke and the world is laughing at them.
Comment109	His reasoning is flawed... Not sure what he is up to.
Comment110	Get it done get out respect people choices.
Comment 110.1	@maki s yeah they&#39;re actually doing their job and representing the split opinion of the public!
Comment 110.2	OUR sovereign Parliament of OUR UK with OUR representative democracy represents over 63 million not just the 17.4 million whiney brexiters and everyone knows the best deal is no brexit. The only good brexit is a dead brexit. Get THAT done. Kill it.
Comment 110.3	@Blackstar 76 well it&#39;s not the people it&#39;s the MP from the start they don&#39;t know what they want.
Comment 110.4	The people want to remain. That&#39;s been the case since 2017. The 2016 referendum result is out of date and needs redoing.
Comment111	I&#39;ve lost faith in you now Borris I thought you were going to do it but  no another Theresa May
Comment112	Games Up Boris. Every time he opens his mouth it&#39;s just more lies. This brexit mess is a Tory mess miss managed from day one. How many times did Boris vote against a deal?
Comment113	I hope he can give us that election, govt is fucked rn
Comment114	Boris your a massive let down ..... We needs Brexit party
Comment 114.1	@gary Hinchliffe haha you still think we&#39;re leaving! Bless!
Comment 114.2	@gary Hinchliffe if you don&#39;t like europe fuck off to America.
Comment 114.3	You can go live in Brussels when we leave EU .....do me a favour don&#39;t come back 😂😅🤣😜
Comment 114.4	UK will never elect a fascist government. Move to US if that&#39;s what you want.
Comment115	It’s quite obvious now that brexit is never going to happen, but it may dent democracy for ever and open the door for even more undemocratic moves later on.
Comment 115.1	We don&#39;t have direct democracy  we have representative democracy which is why OUR Parliament MUST take into consideration over 63 million people and not just the 17.4 million whiney brexiters.
Comment116	B Johnson has called new elections to see his side lose and thus compromise the brexit 🤣🤣 a traitor in truth
Comment117	Nigel for Brexit. The only person that will do it.
Comment 117.1	No thanks I don&#39;t want the extreme right wing fascists in Parliament. They&#39;ll make an even bigger mess of it than the conservative party has so far even though it doesn&#39;t seem possible that it could get even worse.
Comment 117.2	So you want a fascist in charge? Glad the rest of the country knows better. That prick couldn&#39;t even get elected as an MP despite 7 attempts! He has no chance of being PM!
Comment118	Sooooo.... ummmmm...... still no Brexit?
Comment 118.1	Public Public I wouldn&#39;t profit from it even if it was beneficial for the uk, since I don&#39;t live there😂
Comment 118.2	so how do YOU profit from brexit?<br />WE know brexit was funded to crash the pound.
Comment119	Why are these guys and their media partners scared of an election?
Comment 119.1	@Anthony Uremeh what media supporters??? The entire mainstream media has been instructed to smear and ridicule him from day one by their billionaire owners.
Comment 119.2	@Blackstar 76 So the election is not to the advantage of Cobyn and his media supporters then? He&#39;s been shouting about elections for over 2 years now, what changed? He knows the mood of the nation. If he&#39;s so confident about his proposals, he should come to the people. Why is that difficult?
Comment 119.3	Nobody&#39;s scared of an election, what are you talking about? Every political party will seek to time elections to their advantage. There&#39;s nothing sinister or unusual about that.
Comment120	Since the EU decided to withheld the verdict for extension, I think the opposition will be forced to vote on the deal rather than have an election or no-deal brexit.
Comment121	Full of crap he could not get out of bed on time
Comment 121.1	A comment as daft as your name.
Comment122	Johnson said we could take control of our own borders. Now he has negotiated a border that means we will need ID even to travel to other parts of the UK (ie. Northern Ireland)
Comment 122.1	common travel area will remain &amp;  btw you currently need ID to travel to N Ireland from GB
Comment123	stop talking and leave!!!
Comment 123.1	I would say the same to you, Boyko Vaseline
Comment124	Boris has no clue what to do. If you havent found a good agreement yet, you wont.  Boris lied about his little red Bus.  He has fake hair and fake outrage.

Comment126	The idiots have already had 3 years to read the deal, all they need to read is amendments FFS
Comment 126.1	Not so easy ;-)
Comment 126.2	While it is a repeat of Theresa Mays deal with a boarder down the Irish sea, the government only published the details a couple of days ago so MP&#39;s need to read it and understand before committing the UK to something that the EU seems very keen to push through
Comment127	Apart from when he opens his mouth, the other sure fire way to know he is lying is the smirk on his face. <br />Laura has to be close to slapping him around the face!! I know I would.
Comment 127.1	So it&#39;s okay for the opposition squatters to wheel and deal, lie and obstruct, but when the PM tries to play the same political game in order to simply attempt to deliver Brexit, then you don&#39;t like it. I see.
Comment128	Who is running the country while all this nonsense is going on?<br />Haven&#39;t heard any complaints.<br />Perhaps the country can run quite well without these layabouts in parliament??<br />Seems to be doing ok without them!!!!!
Comment 128.1	The elite run the country.<br />At all times.
Comment 128.2	thias House is dead.

Comment 129.2	Joe shmoe - the Social Security will pay it for you.
Comment130	Just read through some of the comments. The impression you get from Tories and Brexiteers is that they&#39;re paranoid and whiny.
Comment131	Brexit song is shit about the budget and the Conservatives are the same criminal parties that are not special to the British intellect and the Conservatives are the same criminal parties that are not special to the British intellect and the Conservatives are the same criminal parties that are not special to the British intellect.
Comment132	Has he chosen his preferred ditch yet?
Comment 132.1	He is not funny but in reality he is not cruel and he has a lot more 6AM and he is not a problem in 7AM but I 2AM and the only other people are fools and the Conservatives have to be honest about this and we have a good evening and we have a great video of a pug in nappies.
Comment133	Cancel brexit
Comment134	Listen to this idiot. Campaign day after day to release this country from the clutches of... a decade of Tory fuckups?
Comment135	You are witnessing the beginning of Boris&#39; end. The lies are unfurling and Boris is in a ditch drowning in his own false soundbites.
Comment136	Go Boris! Brilliant. Glory to God. Thank you so much Boris for not putting up with non-sense 3.5 years of fallen MPs that cannot deliver Brexit from a referendum that was won square and fair. Please understand, Repent everyone!, Accept Jesus as our saviour, get baptised receive the Gift of the Holy Spirit start to walk with Jesus (be reborn - hence the Holy Spirit and the Jesus in you - know how to truly rejoice no matter what in your spirit - not living by the flesh which is such looking for trouble..) and have a relationship with God (forget about religion); thus you can obey God (know how to defend yourself and others against Evil&#39;s attacks every day.. begin a meaningful life not of the children of the Lies..).

Comment141	Politics aside...... He’s so cute tho” ☺️
Comment142	Laura is the textbook example of biased reporting
Comment143	Remoaners are intent on stopping Brexit, however that happens. BBC is fooled again, Labour, Lib Dems, SNP (separatist party, let&#39;s call them what they are. The Bloc in Canada cannot be asked to cooperate, they&#39;re separatists. Labour has also indicated they want an amendment for a 2nd referendum for their support of Boris&#39; deal. Come on BBC, stop being duped!
Comment144	STOP LYING BORIS THIS DEAL STILL TIES US WITH THE EU AND GIVES AWAY £BILLIONS. WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR PROMISES...&quot;WE WILL LEAVE WITH OR WITHOUT A DEAL ON THE 31ST OCTOBER&quot; ?????????????????? LIES LIES LIES
Comment145	"A text book example of lousy reporting.  At <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlG6P4lD2Y&amp;t=3m02s"">3:02</a> the word &#39;blackmail&#39; is used.  A definition of the word is &quot;the action, treated as a criminal offense, of demanding payment or another benefit from someone in return for not revealing compromising or damaging information about them.&quot;  The choice of word was inappropiate.  The use of it carries a very negative connotation.  Regardless of whether the PM is acting ethically, it is not blackmai."
Comment 145.1	Come now, this is only the BBC, you can&#39;t expected any reasonable standards of reporting beyond &#39;but muh globalism&#39;.
Comment146	Now labour, liberal, Green Party put up or shut the f**k up! NO DEAL IS THE ONLY TRUE EXIT! 🤬👎🏼🇪🇺😤
Comment147	Now do or die is finished. New trick . Election...utter crap
Comment148	Laura the interviewer.. A remainer obviously &quot;...more tiiiiiime...&#39;  trying to tell the PM how to do Brexit lol.

Comment 148.2	@fricozoid1 I will say what I like dont like it piss off
Comment 148.3	@Suck MyToe what&#39;s your point?
Comment 148.4	@fricozoid1 I would say looking at them traitors allday lib dems and labour is a joke and the world is laughing at them and the english people labour destroyed my town I watched my labour mayor stand in court for a rape gang snd keep his job
Comment 148.5	@Aphrodite&#39;s Child Brilliant  (:
Comment149	Dont know about keep the red flag flying,jez and crew have covered it in chicken shit
Comment150	scrutiny? you wont the house to vote on a blank paper ... how can anyone trust you ... you are a known lair ... PM  Boris Johnson  is a dictator ... man is a joke be hornet you are running down  time  and blame others for the mess you have created ...
Comment 150.1	How is someone who asked for a general election twice a dictator? Remain MPs promised to honour the Brexit referendum and voted to trigger Brexit by voting for Article 50. How is it Boris&#39;s fault that they all lied and changed their minds? They want to ignore the referendum and cancel Brexit!
Comment151	We are the ones being done.<br />The very best deal is no brexit and everyone knows it.
Comment 151.1	@stoufer2000 Fair enough. Thank you for clarifying that. Everyone makes mistakes some time or another.<br />WE were promised a good deal BEFORE leaving... where is it?<br />There are plenty who voted for brexit with that good deal promise who have now changed their mind on brexit altogether due to a mistaken trust of brexiter spin.
Comment 151.2	sorry misread you original post! my mistake.. agree with you
Comment 151.3	@stoufer2000 brexit was funded to crash the pound.... how much money have you invested in the pound being brexit crashed? Because if you want brexit and you haven&#39;t changed your money for euros or dollars you are the biggest mug talking about self harm....
Comment 151.4	@RenegadeRaida no the best deal for everyone in the UK as a matter of fact .... As for the petty number of EU migrants which is a tiny number compared to those coming from outside the EU leaving the EU wont change that factor if much at all so shove your deliberate brexiter LIES. You brexiters are the greatest danger to OUR UK and OUR wealth and standard of living.
Comment 151.5	Lol, nobody has a clue what you self harmers are doing
Comment152	Joke of a government , beaten only by the people who slavishly back them. How the hell can you look at the conservatives , what they do to the country, and think &quot;oh yes more please&quot;
Comment153	Amazing 95% of the deal is ex PM Teresa May deal ... this must be a joke
Comment 153.1	@Paul c I think you misunderstood my comment, &#39;impressive hypocrisy&#39; is in no way a compliment.
Comment 153.2	Johnson and the right wing in general is moronic.
Comment 153.3	@cyrilo30837 That would totally be fine but they have become too controlling and through contracts that was passed for one reason that might have been a good idea at the time are now been abused for other agendas, and now the E.U are over ruling a countries government and doing stuff like forcing countries to take in millions of so called refugees without a say,we must leave with no deal, the Currupt E.U is a sinking ship anyway we are best to get off now, trying to control many nations with a piece of legal paper and bullying them will only last so long before chaos errupts.
Comment 153.4	We already have the &quot;Best deal&quot;....Full membership of the EU....Period
Comment 153.5	@fricozoid1 you can box a turd in an 18crt gold box and yu will be excited until you see it.
Comment154	So.... what exactly is the BBC&#39;s excuse for not reporting the million plus demonstration in London against brexit in their Youtube account? Was it a political decision?
Comment 154.1	Public Public- I totally agree with the sentiment but I think it would be misrepresented on a global platform like youtube as pro remain bias. They covered it on UK TV and the website.. I presume they stick to interviews and reporting on parliament on youtube for obvious reasons. Plenty of people seem to be able to upload their content to anyway so it&#39;s always available. The problem for me is that that Parliament seems to be ignoring the massive but mostly peaceful show of numbers of people on the streets supporting a peoples vote in the options on offer.
Comment 154.2	@stoufer2000 if over a million people demonstrating in the streets is ignored on any of their news channels there has to be a reason because an over one million person demonstration with no counter demonstration isn&#39;t a minor matter.
Comment 154.3	They reported it on the main website. They don&#39;t put everything on youtube
Comment155	"What is happening? The left in America and the uk are attacking democracy! Are Momentum and the young turks in league with each other?

Comment156	Great guy, wish him all the best
Comment157	Good luck Boris. The man has done everything to leave by October 31st and can be in no way blamed.
Comment 157.1	Wat ching u &quot;And can be in no way blamed.&quot; HE&#39;S HE PRIME MINISTER, SINCE WHEN HAS A PRIME MINISTER EVER DONE WHAT THE OPPOSITION HAS SAID?! GET THIS COWARD OUT!
Comment 157.2	Leaving so quickly with such little review is suicide
Comment158	Powerless UKPLC under draconian Matriarchal nanny state closes Christian Housing Association using local Social Services.
Comment159	If PM Boris can show us more than Brexit is to be done across GB, if he can put internet across GB, money into NHS and Social Care, build more houses to enable companies and people to move away from London, improve train transport across the UK, and do something about the homeless, then I shall vote him in and keep voting him in at every term. If he states these improvements in The Mandate and then does not focus on doing them, I shall not vote him in after first term.

Comment162	I give up Cannot watch this anymore
Comment163	Pleeeaase give me a General Election if I allow you a measly 2 days to scrutinise my crappy deal, then I can win a General Election while I’m on the front foot. Same old fat, self-serving liar, only thinking of himself and the Tories and not what’s right for the British People. Transparent and about as likely to get a General Election on Dec 12th as I am of swimming to the moon!
Comment 163.1	Pretty much.
Comment164	He won&#39;t get an election unless Labour backbenchers go against the whip and vote in favour as Corbyn knows its not looking good for him or his party in the polls and thus will keep turning the offer of an election down as he knows Labour will be in big trouble.
Comment165	What happened to leaving anyway on 31st Oct?
Comment 165.1	@Blackstar 76 But the polls said that before the referendum....<br />Clearly polling is biased. Only the actual vote is accurate.
Comment 165.2	@stuart Nicklin there have been 96 published polls (mostly yougov) over the period since July 2017 and all of them except ONE showed a majority of respondents thought voting leave in 2016 was the wrong decision.<br /><br />See Wikipedia page.
Comment 165.3	"@stuart Nicklin how am I making it up, that&#39;s what an overview of all polls shows. Wikipedia has a huge amount of info:<br /><br />&quot;Support rose again to a plurality until the 2017 General Election. Since then, opinion polls have tended to show a plurality of support for remaining in the EU or for the view that Brexit was a mistake, with the estimated margin increasing until a small decrease in 2019 (to 53% Remain : 47% Leave, as of October 2019).&quot;<br /><br />See the &#39;Post-referendum polling&#39; section on this page. The numbers couldn&#39;t be clearer!<br /><br /><a href=""https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum"">https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_United_Kingdom_European_Union_membership_referendum</a>"
Comment 165.4	@Blackstar 76 check out this fact. More people in scotland voted to leave the EU than voted for the SNP at the general election.<br />The turn out was 80%. You are just making up that since 2017 remain would win. What poll has tested 80%? You are just making things up.<br />In reality the labour party&#39;s attitude to brexit is going to cost them 100 seats. It a Margaret Thatcher moment when a whole generation turns against them. They have contempt for the public and you have confirmed that.
Comment166	And we all know when she interview Jeremy Corbyn or the other remoaner losers she will not keep putting to him that he only wants time not to scrutinize the deal but to frustrate this Brexit deal and force another extension and ultimately reverse Brexit all the time knowing the people would smash the Labour Party for their treachery in a general election... 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿 🏴󠁧󠁢󠁳󠁣󠁴󠁿  🏴󠁧󠁢󠁷󠁬󠁳󠁿 🇬🇧
Comment167	He uses positive words all the time like excellent, reminds me of a window sales man form the 80&#39;s
Comment168	Laura err.
Comment 168.1	Can&#39;t the BBC find some transgender Asian capitalist to replace Laura yet. I mean where&#39;s the diversity....Yes i replied to my own message because it was relevant.
Comment169	Problem with parliament is that it&#39;s filled with gravy train narcissists and pontificating virtue signalling imbeciles!!
Comment 169.1	Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn are the most expensive ones for the unemployed but I cited some of the sky news and you probably have no comment on your comments on your website or not to see your child wear it is not cruel.
Comment170	You mean Boris is the only leader with an actual back bone,<br />well done Boris teach the parliamentary children how a leader, leads. The<br />parliamentary children who cannot take leadership must be shipped or tunnelled<br />over to EU Junka who will tuck them into bed and change their parliamentary<br />nappies for them.<br /><br /><br />It&#39;s not a mess, this is what leaders do, lead. This type of<br />leadership has been lacking from the British parliament for too long a time,<br />all snowflakes must report to their mommy and daddy the EU where Junka will<br />tell tuck you into bed and tell you all what to do and let the British govern<br />the British people.<br /><br /><br /> <br /><br /><br /> manny decker I do not<br />like Boris but Boris is the only one that, at this time, because Boris has no<br />loyalty, Is the one that is putting on a good impression of getting the UK out<br />of the EU, for many years I have not seen anything good about the EU, the EU<br />told Greece to be the holiday destination for the EU so must build as many<br />holiday apartment as the Greeks can manage, the Germans lent the Greeks as much<br />money and the Greeks ask for then the market fell and the Germans demanded<br />their money back with interest, quadruple Greeks committed suicide. The 3<br />leaders of the EU gave the EU Parliament 1 choice, not 2/3/4 just one choice to<br />replace Junka whose retiring on the best pension he could possibly ask for and<br />everyone says that the EU parliament is a fare Democratic institution. Why have<br />two EU parliament, is that not greed and opulence. Do you know the German and<br />French farmers have never made a profit, they get welfare benefit from the ECB,<br />you cannot imagine the stich up the EU is you fricking idiot. The Germans have<br />a direct pipeline from Russian, the Germans then sell that oil and gas on to<br />the rest of the EU especially to the UK for inflated prices, Yet Russian is<br />under sanctions, now you know why President Obama tapped Angela Merkels phone<br />to find out what the hell is going on. I could go on and I have nothing good to<br />say about the EU but remoaners are sheep too stupid to get it. I ask<br />politicians and intellects why they want to stay in the EU and they always say<br />the same thing to stop the Germans and the French from starting world war 3,<br />how PATHETIC is that. Notice I do not want the UK to leave the EU because<br />someone told me so, or it was the figure on the side of a bus nor any of the<br />PATHETIC reasons remoaners think Brexiters want to leave the EU for. Well done<br />Boris and Nigel and I do not like either of them, I do not like Nigel, I had to<br />stop myself from puking when I put my cross in the box for the Brexit party.
Comment 170.1	@Pablo GalbraithCORRECT me PABLO with my inaccuracies and misconception while I go outside and get some FRESH AIR as recommended by you, I want to LEARN, educate me and why do you want to remain, do you travel abroad Pablo, what do you love about the EU.
Comment 170.2	@dan112020 Congratulations, every single point you made in your response was incorrect. I&#39;m not a brexiteer, I&#39;m remain. Your rant (yes rant) is full of inaccuracy and misconception. I don&#39;t know what you&#39;re trying to imply about my name, try and elaborate - or maybe just go outside, get some fresh air mate  :)
Comment 170.3	@Pablo GalbraithYou&#39;re brexiteer, my rant (comment ) is a pro brexit comment, You make no sense at all with your comment, I have no right or left wing views nor conspiracy theory. Are you sure it is my comment you have read and are commenting about PABLO, that might give it away.
Comment 170.4	I only read the last sentence of your literally insane rant: &quot;when I put a cross in the box for the brexit party&quot; and from that I decided that you are an idiot and won&#39;t humour you my reading the rest of your right-wing conspiracy theory  :)
Comment171	Postponement of brexit is great news for the advertising business - another 100 million budget. Well done blojob!.
Comment172	I heard an mp on radio 4 this morning say they are prepared to work Fridays and weekends to get brexit done..so Friday isn&#39;t a normal working day for them ???
Comment 172.1	They&#39;re in their constituencies, where they should be
Comment173	Sorry but this guy is making perfect sense. 👍🏻
Comment 173.1	Is this ironic
Comment174	Come on BBC more homogeneous intent,about time you were soughted out,not worth the Licence fee.
Comment175	Orrdeeerrr! I am from the future 9657 year! The breaking news here is : the UK negotiation for brexit is still pending !  😁😂😂😋😋😋😋
Comment176	Corrupt, lying, extreme left wing, treacherous BBC...where&#39;s the ditch Boris? Drain the swamp in parliament...have the election sooner!! Cancel your tv licence!!!!
Comment 176.1	Did you lose your tin foil hat or something, chill out
Comment177	Fuckin lair spend £100 million for get ready for brexit ad waste of taxpayers money it’s better spend on nhs
Comment178	pathetic procrastination! Get us out!!
Comment179	You said we would leave with or without a deal on 31st October therefore that must have covered leaving without a deal, so why<br />don&#39;t you do no deal exit as Corbyn won&#39;t agree the deal. a clean break is the best option as it gives you a stronger bargaining<br />position and save us paying billions to Brussels and stop us locked in to EU for generations.  Your deal is absolute rubbish and even<br />has a three year transition during which time EU can pass laws for us to pay whatever they want without us having any say, plus<br />others we will never get out of.  So Boris if you want to stay in power KEEP YOUR WORD and go for a clean break, no going back.
Comment 179.1	@Dennis Randall Are you blaming us funding our own defence on the EU as well now? Bloody hell, I&#39;m really curious who you&#39;ll blame once we&#39;ve left. I talk facts, look them up. My figures don&#39;t include the cost of the economy shrinking, 100m on prepare for brexit advertising and most recently, minting a brexit 50p coin to celebrate the 31st (haha). The <b>fact</b> is, no deal will cost the UK more than EU membership. Truth.
Comment 179.2	@fricozoid1 You have got to be joking,it has cost us more then 12 Billion building 2 new carriers and other vessels, new<br />aircraft and up date our armed forces and nuclear subs which EU want to take over and for us to continue maintaining,<br />and during the three year transition they will make us pay billions more so don&#39;t talk rubbish.
Comment 179.3	Cost of the EU to UK = 12bn<br />Cost of No Deal to UK = 15bn
Comment180	mr BJ 😆🤣💦@====8
Comment181	Help me understand why “Labour Party” would be reluctant for an election? As an outsider what I see is that Conservatives have been incompetent and labour is a de facto change element; I don’t surely believe that people will vote the conservatives again; there is a leftward movement coming to both UK and the US; hoping to see crushing defeat of the Conservative party in the UK and JC and the prime minister as Bernie or Warren lead US. That would be epic change coming to the world. I am hopeful guys. Good days are coming.
Comment 181.1	@Pablo Galbraith No   MP is a traitor, but I agree Corbyn talking to people like the IRA he should not have done.
Comment 181.2	@Manchester Is Red This guy again... Look mate you have no right going round calling people deluded when you literally think Brexit was a good idea for the country - spend more time in school not the YouTube comments section
Comment 181.3	bijay adhikari you&#39;re so deluded...do you get all your news off the BBC? Corbyn is best mates with the Ira and anjem choudary...he&#39;s a traitor that should swing from a post
Comment182	Who is the irritating women holding the MIC who wants another 3 years of tumbling down the rabbit hole of uncertainty. Does she not have a ears or eyes??? HELLO MC FLY - we want to LEAVE!!!! - The PM is doing what the people voted to-do LEAVE!!!!
Comment183	We need a new referendum not a election so you can pass this mess to others.
Comment184	Kudos to audio clarity!
Comment185	Go Boris! You are a champion.
Comment 185.1	I can&#39;t tell if this is sarcasm
Comment186	What a charlatan, he has no shame, no morality and no authority quite frankly. An embarrassment for the country.
Comment 186.1	No shame or morality? Remain MPs were elected on manifestos that promised to honour Brexit. They then voted to trigger Brexit with Article 50. Then they change their mind, and say they want to cancel Brexit altogether? They are the ones who are shameless and undemocratic.<br />No authority? They refused a general election because they knew they&#39;d lose and be booted out of parliament! They should have no authority, but somehow here they are!
Comment 186.2	Willy Vonka
Comment 186.3	Vonka you misspelled your avatar it should be WONKER !!!
Comment 186.4	Vonka .- I’m pretty sure you said this about the last 25 tori pm’s. Keep it oto yourself
Comment187	What a clown. He gets no 2/3, because he could still leave with no deal and he could change the GE date after the vote XD it’s again a political stunt against labs. That’s all that he is a conman. If lab goes 4 it, they know they vote 4 no deal. Make a informed referendum (make it binding by law) and get your own information, no newspapers!!! Read the treaty, read yellow hammer, read what trade deals are out there (the EU doesn’t have) read what companies and unions are saying, and decide finally.
Comment188	That Laura is scraping the barrel now, Boris has stumped her..........I can see what&#39;s happening, BBC reporters ask what the Governments next move is, and that information is relayed to the remoaners, not knowing that Boris, Cummings and JRM are already one step ahead of them at every corner.
Comment189	When you&#39;ve sat on your backside and done nothing for over three years and been payed why let someone vote to change it if I&#39;d been payed for three years for doing nothing I&#39;d be the same it&#39;s us that&#39;s the idiot&#39;s they&#39;re loving this
Comment190	The parliamentarians keep banging on about the sovereignty of parliament, that sovereignty stems from the people so let the people vote in a general election to restore that sovereignty !
Comment 190.1	@K C Lol we&#39;re in agreement. Edited the comment to make it more clear.
Comment 190.2	@Dean Huppert Oh maybe I misjudged. I thought you meant let the people vote in 2nd ref. You mean an election. Yes I agree. Election is the right way forward if any PM asks for one. The opposition is there to say we are better and we should take over. So they should always agree when asked. The fixed term parliaments act was only brought in by Cameron because of Brown. I don&#39;t see a reason for 2nd ref until result of 1st is implemented. But anyone asking for 2nd ref needs to define how a result would be implemented if close. No one knows how it will be. They were saying 1.2m was close. Notice how they refuse to speak of such things. One person more than less they will be saying &quot;democracy has been done, let&#39;s stay in - they are so baIsed. And so is the BBC.
Comment 190.3	@K C I obviously agree that wouldn&#39;t be a democratic mandate because the majority would be within the margin of error. That is not what the outcome of the vote was though, Leave was 17.4 million and Remain was 16.1 million. That&#39;s a majority of 1,269,501 people !  Not 5 people, very different. Then to your point of a second referendum, you may have your second referendum in a generation once the result of the first has been implemented :)
Comment 190.4	Dean. Result of your 2nd vote.... 17,000,000 out and 17,000,005 Remain. What then mate? We stay? Democracy has spoken... because this time it went your way? I guarantee within a week the media will find 6 people who changed their mind and we need a 3rd referendum! Tell people how it will reasonably work or 2nd ref cannot happen.
Comment191	"Dear Mr. Prime Minister Boris Johnson<br />I fear, that any Brexit might be contraproductive according to Global Goals<br />of Equality in Human Kind and Greenity on Planet Earth. <br />Here is an Open Video Letter for You, Mr. Prime Minister Boris Johnson<br /><a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Ug-FmeQ-c"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5Ug-FmeQ-c</a><br />Best wishes<br />@Christian_Human"
Comment192	Funny how the BBC took the comments off for the 39 dead Chinese video it really goes to show what a big distraction it is to keep the population glued to it to forget how undemocratic this country really is
Comment193	I&#39;m getting sick of listening to this parliament is no longer fit for purpose its just basically a burden on the taxpayers these politicians are taking the piss they don&#39;t want an election they don&#39;t want to deliver the result of the referendum I suppose when you get payed for doing nothing why change it
Comment194	Is there a ditch big enough for Boris and his ego?
Comment195	Trump with accent
Comment196	Great PM UK lucky to have him hes doer!
Comment 196.1	Deipatrous No he’s not. Prefer him than Jeremy Corbyn
Comment 196.2	idiot
Comment197	I am watching this man😀 just to improve my English
Comment198	What happened to leaving on 31st? Clean break. Now.
Comment199	Hollywood really needs to make a movie or TV series about the Brexit chaos! It would smash the box office!
Comment 199.1	It would be great for those who have trouble sleeping.<br />Brexit: Are We There Yet?
Comment 199.2	The Black Sheep yeah like we&#39;ve not had enough already
Comment200	Keep going Boris.... brexit will happen!
Comment201	Putting pressure where it is due. Good man. <br />Think the Brexit Party and Lib Dems will scupper any election though with a hung parliament.
Comment202	Laura is so bias in these interviews it&#39;s unreal
Comment 202.1	@Alex Scott I accept the result. So, why can&#39;t you accept the reality? Brexit is bad for you, me and our children. Be a man and take responsibility for your actions.
Comment 202.2	@Alex Scott the BBC is unbiased. Just because your personal perception of centrist is shifted, doesn&#39;t mean the principle has changed. Laura at no point expresses an opinion, and only asks difficult questions because it&#39;s literally her job, the interview would not be informative at all if she just threw him soft questions for five minutes
Comment 202.3	@fricozoid1 oh no another triggered remainer. Can&#39;t accept a result so just cry like a baby. You people are a joke to democracy.
Comment 202.4	@Pablo Galbraith yeah the whole point of a media outlet is to be unbias. I can clearly see you want to remain in a donkey EU government. Go live abroad if you love EU so much.
Comment 202.5	At least she&#39;s biased in the right direction you moron
Comment203	J corbryn reminds me of a film called the plank he is as thick as a short plank l don&#39;t want this &amp; l don&#39;t want that there&#39;s a song called making your mind up have you heard it corbyn you should you should play it some time
Comment 203.1	Geoffrey Weatherall - J corBRYN, is he Welsh now? Bet shit like “Making Your Mind Up” is top of your hit parade!😂
Comment 203.2	JC is no fool, why would he agree to a GE when he can wait and watch Boris&#39;s lies unfold, then later call a no confidence motion once Boris is dead in a ditch.
Comment 203.3	Jeremy Corbyn is a good lad  ! Peace
Comment204	Really he just wants an election so he can take the uk out of the eu while parliament is dissolved ( i.e no opposition). A December election would mean he can get out before the tax avoidance laws kick in, which is the real goal here for the conservatives.
Comment 204.1	precisely it&#39;s those pesky EU tax avoidance laws that  Brexit is really all about ;  plus the chance sell off the NHS
Comment 204.2	You have just made that up. He has a deal.
Comment205	the Big Biased Corporation with another wonderful piece of propaganda
Comment206	J corbryn doesn&#39;t want an erctoin A&#39;s he is running scared Xmas election he will be in Mexico with said wife 😂 every time I see this man l can see the shit running down his trousers when I see those on their front bench half asleep 😂 and playing with there phones it&#39;s disgusting not fit to run a country??
Comment207	Well...<br />Apart from the obvious stupidity of the lies and misinformation that now leads to a Brexit ... the only thing I really pity, is the fact that those people who propose and supported the notion of Brexit ... that those people will NOT suffer it’s consequences.<br />Like the gentleman who watched UPSTAIRS-DOWNSTAIRS one to many times as a kid... he moved his business to Dublin to AVOID any consequences.<br />So in essence ... preaching water-drinking wine... the very old story...how sad...
Comment 207.1	Exactly they have to suffer their own NEPOTISM instead.
Comment208	Just repeating yourself doesn’t mean you’re actually saying anything.
Comment 208.1	@Skystalker he&#39;s fooling the fools by appearing he&#39;s hanging himself or dying in the gutter where he should be, <br /><br />Just ask Farage it is a trick of a deal, people in parliament are more intelligent than that, although agree many have E.U. bias.
Comment 208.2	Well he is saying something. He is saying I want to leave, but i cant because hung parliament wont let me.  The problem is you and the women interviewing need to take the WAX out of your ears.
Comment 208.3	In fact he deceives even more often
Comment209	the eu Quisling&#39;s the vanguard of the EU&#39;s political invasion of the UK will never agree to any deal. so a election must be called to get these rats out of Parliament ASAP <br /><br />labour under old man steptoe is finished expect mass replacement of labour MPs by Tory and brexit party  MPs
Comment 209.1	This is the funniest comment I&#39;ve seen so far. You clearly don&#39;t understand how government even works in this country so please keep you uninformed rants off the internet  :)
Comment210	The man who doesn&#39;t know the comb. Boris Johnson lol
Comment 210.1	@Mackem Scouse who cares about footballers and rappers? And about the people who not representing your country internationally.
Comment 210.2	@Mackem Scouse dude he&#39;s the PM in the UK so he should be looking like the man who represents the people of the UK. Not like somebody who awakes drunken in a ditch . Haha
Comment 210.3	Have you ever noticed the stupid hairstyles footballers and rappers have? Not to mention some of what youths wear.Have you criticised them?
Comment211	He is 100 % pretend ignorance. He all along wanted to postpone it. He is doing exactly what the EU want because all British and EU leaders are Zionist owned and who runs the EU Rothschilds. Folk this is all 1 big show were the people have no say and you have all been taken along for a ride. You do realise if there is another election it would be rigged but i believe they have something else in store that will unite us through fear. Prepare yourself for a massive deception
Comment212	I wonder what he is going to call his book after he has fucked the country.
Comment213	"Dear BBC News,<br />Thank you for posting.<br />Minute <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GrlG6P4lD2Y&amp;t=0m03s"">0:03</a><br />Now showing live, exclusively in the U.K., the making of:<br /><b>&quot;The Indian in the Cupboard&quot;</b><br />Oh, he just finished the cabinet. 😲<br />I can&#39;t wait to see that fine craftsmanship. 😁👍<br />Love from 💕<br />Michigan<br />USA 🇺🇸<br />Peace <br />(.. of work this government is) 😞"
Comment214	I can&#39;t believe BJs brass neck<br />Lecturing on morals ! !
Comment 214.1	Ben French You support weasels, cowards &amp; Commie toe rags.....good luck comrade.
Comment 214.2	@A S Humphrey nope, they both completely dishonest scumbags that should not be in &#39;public service&#39;, we have better people in this country, just not in parliament.
Comment 214.3	A S Humphrey yes we would thanks pal
Comment 214.4	Jonathan Tatler You prefer Commie Corbinoff one of the worlds biggest weasel cowardly traitors or the worthless Socialist left wing Globalist clowns.....perhaps.
Comment215	"Regardless of the outcome from the EU you are in for a rough time in the UK. It will take years to recover from this <a href=""http://debacle.an/"">debacle.An</a> other referendum and the the possibility of a election. What are they thinking. The best of luck Great Britain."
Comment216	Ha ha this presenter is a true delusional BBC presenter.   Leave without a deal  Parliament is a joke you can not trust them   They are in bed with the EU.  Traitors
Comment 216.1	It&#39;s like you tried to type this message with your tin foil hat over your eyes
Comment217	Nice to hear u sir...   voice is amazing dub. ... ,😄
Comment218	What exactly does he mean with &quot;this country&quot; ?<br />Does that include NI and Scotland?
Comment 218.1	@Fonzie thanks
Comment 218.2	@Leeuwy Wish you all the best being an independent part of the EU :)
Comment 218.3	@Fonzie coming soon  ...
Comment 218.4	@Leeuwy I missed the vote for independence sorry.
Comment 218.5	@Fonzie there will NOT be a hard border between NI and the Republic of Ireland.<br />Instead the border will be between the two islands, which actually means the UK accepts a border within its own country  ... first step to independence for NI.
Comment219	What&#39;s with all the dramatic pauses Boris? Let me guess who you&#39;re trying to impersonate, William Shatner? or Tony Blair perhaps...
Comment 219.1	Indeed! Prime Ministers in general seem to get away with breaking the law and having no action taken against them, as we&#39;ve then in the past few weeks.
Comment 219.2	Gary Stevens Tony Blair should be hung for war crimes the traitor
Comment220	he likes to hear himself talking
Comment221	The globalist are in charge of this puppet government ! Just leave on the 31st as promised without a deal!
Comment 221.1	I agree, if they don’t leave soon there is probably going to be a lot of riots at London.
Comment 221.2	Your spot on, <br />The very 1st promise he made in the Tory leadership race <br />Was he would give them millions of tax breaks as he screws the poor and the disabled.
Comment222	Having successfully managed to fool his supporters that he&#39;s got &quot;a good deal&quot; <br />As Nigel say&#39;s how the hell is it a &quot;good deal&quot; <br />You can&#39;t offer anything better than E.U. tariff rates or anything else to any other countries<br />UK will continue to pay millions as now, for another 3years or more etc<br /><br /> Boris wants to give millions of tax breaks to his super rich friends, <br />While he continues to screw the poor, and the disabled... <br />His very 1st promise to his super rich friends when he was in the Tory leadership race.
Comment 222.1	@Jude Lind Farage hasn&#39;t got caught with his pants down yet, <br />So I&#39;m willing to give him the benefit of the doubt.
Comment 222.2	@Swag Man I want Brexit done ASAP for democracies sake but Boris is not the cheat that I could trust, I used to trust Rees Mog but even he&#39;s bound by Tory collective lying pacts, <br />So Nigel Farage although all other policies is f&#39;d up, I do trust him on Brexit.
Comment 222.3	I keep reading about how Boris wants brexit as part of some elaborate hedge fund scheme for millionaires.  Well the New European which is hardly pro brexit wrote an article online completely debunking it. How are the super rich supposed to benefit from brexit when many have their money tied up in the EU. You do understand how globalist economics work. It would be like a boxer punching themselves in the face to win a fight. Even the Americans bankers and corporations are heavily invested in EU countries despite any trade war for political reasons. What this is really about is the majority in parliament and millions of people in the UK can&#39;t stand the fact that the leave vote won. &quot;I lost you cheated so I don&#39;t recognise your victory&quot;. You are like spolit children. I&#39;m from Belfast. Brexit will affect all of us. But even I respect the result. We need an election before the end of the year. It is just cowardice otherwise.
Comment 222.4	It&#39;s funny because y&#39;all are smart enough to realise that Boris is tricking you guys but not that Farage is doing the exact same thing. Funny that.
Comment 222.5	Why trust Nigel?
Comment223	The government breaks promises and increases debt, not Parliamentarians in general.
Comment224	What a bullshit artist.
Comment225	Not being funny but why do we pay MP&#39;s  79k base salary???? They don&#39;t exactly show value for money considering all they do is break promises and increase the UK debt.
Comment 225.1	Spot on.  Time to make being an MP unpaid again, so that those who really want to do something for their country take the post, not those who want to make a career out of robbing the taxpayer.
Comment226	Mehdi hassan needs to interview him.
Comment227	The bias BBC need defunding. Don&#39;t pay your TV licence fee.
Comment 227.1	@Progressive Demagogue Andrew Neil. Now go have a cry snowflake 😂😂😂
Comment 227.2	@killbotone Show me a right wing BBC presenter, or FK OFF.
Comment 227.3	@Progressive Demagogue You have zero proof of this, you may as well say its run by Leprechauns...you cant prove either to be true.
Comment 227.4	Progressive Demagogue - what’s “leftistists” you muppet. Get a grip. 😂
Comment 227.5	@Progressive Demagogue Andrew Neil
Comment228	Dissolve parliament
Comment 228.1	Make me you snowflake.
Comment229	EU give UK all extension time need it:<br />Scrap Brexit<br />Fresh Brexit Referendum👍<br />😇

Comment233	THE CONSERVATIVES HAD A MAJORITY AND WENT TO AN EARLY ELECTION AND LOST IT. TIME FOR JOHNSON TO RESIGN ... AND FIND A COSY DITCH.
Comment 233.1	You don&#39;t even live in the UK. What&#39;s it to you. And I&#39;m from Belfast btw. Keep a private account because if where I live.
Comment 233.2	@Peregrine Slim Oh, shut up. I&#39;m a remainer at heart but Brexit needs to be executed. No second referendum. Just get it done!
Comment 233.3	@Ron Clark There was no referendum.  There was only an opinion poll to decide a position in principle that was to be decided on definitively once complete.
Comment 233.4	The Remainders promised to accept the results of the referendum. They LIED... PERIOD... LIAR, LIAR, PANTS ON FIRE!
Comment234	Great Boris Johnson
Comment235	It&#39;s all a farce the government should deliver  Brexit the people voted and majority won , why Mps from non party In charge get a vote when they have no right to do so it&#39;s the people&#39;s choice not the political puppets they are our servants to do as the majority wants , more seats or not he is in charge and should do what May dodged and ran away from , democracy is dead and only a word end of story yet they want to spread it around the world lol
Comment236	JUST ANOTHER PROPAGANDA PIECE TO CAMERA USING THE BBC AS A COMPLIANT VEHICLE.
Comment237	Queen should step in and dissolve parliament if remainers vote down Brexit deal and vote down Election<br />Queen has a responsibility to end the chaos as the people have no effective functioning government
Comment238	If anyone believes Parliament needs a lot more time to debate this bill, they are very naive. The details of this bill have been thrashed out by hundreds of lawmakers for months and years.
Comment239	Boris is a Lying F2ckwit, it is always someone else&#39;s  fault when he does not keep his word ! The treaty is another version of Mays surrender document. it and Boris need to be consigned to he dust bi of history. Vote for the Brexit  party
Comment240	I can’t believe Parliament has worked for 3.5 years to create an agreement. Completely inept screwing of the British People. <br />Have the remainders stand in front of the media and the public and admit they feel they are more important than their constituents!<br />The Speaker is completely out of control and carries huge bias against Brexit ( a remainder). <br />I love the British but this could destroy their country. The BBC are completely biased and utterly disrespectful.<br /><br />I wish then great success!<br />Peace
Comment 240.1	Majority have backed remain constantly since 2017.
Comment 240.2	😂😂😂😂😂 awh the salty brexitears are delicious 😂😂😂😂
Comment241	What happens if it&#39;s another hung parliament Boris?
Comment 241.1	@Ron Clark Do you think I&#39;m an MP... I want an election but I can&#39;t just decide to have one mate...
Comment 241.2	@Pablo Galbraith Then bring it on if you are so confident of victory! Bring it on! But you won&#39;t...
Comment 241.3	@Kosgei I&#39;m all for a general election and I agree that this parliament is useless and should be scrapped. But we need a more left leaning labour led coalition rather than another tory majority destroying this country
Comment 241.4	@Pablo Galbraith Then give him a chance to lose seats why is Labour keeping the Tories in power when they are confident they will win!  Or is Labour lying to us.<br />This dead parliament must be thrown to the garbage hip where it belongs and the Queen should be returned the powers to dissolve parliament and the fixed term act be thrown out. <br />These MPS cannot be trusted to fire themselves, a bunch of  worse than rats they are!
Comment 241.5	@Ron Clark You remember who else was confident before a tory snap election... That&#39;s right, our good friend Theresa who lost many tory seats - let&#39;s just hope Boris naturally does worse than she did!
Comment242	Never mind the elections! bozo he&#39;ll be dead in a ditch in seven days.    :  )
Comment 242.1	Not before you
Comment 242.2	At least Nixon and Clinton resigned. <br />It&#39;s the era of Trump and Boris , <br />Lie and F*** many people as possible...
Comment 242.3	Do you really think he has any shame at all... <br />You&#39;re talking about a filthy mayor who helps gives public contract and public money out to foreign models to bed them.
Comment243	what a stitch up by parliament have the election first and then the new parliament can have time to talk about this re cooked mays deal get rid of it for the 4 th time and take us out on WTO terms
Comment 243.1	I have freedom of expression sir , and if I see or hear something that I wish to reflect my thoughts about I will and I will do it how I choose - It’s not a competition &amp; requires no justification !
Comment244	&quot;I&#39;d rather lie dead in a ditch&quot;<br />IF Boris is unable to deliver Brexit on 31st, he should resign. If not, he will have a terribly awkward premiership
Comment 244.1	@WillCarr 91 I understand that Parliament has been an obstacle, however Boris staked his entire premiership on leaving on the 31 October, not later. (Do or Die he said)<br /><br />Least he could do to respect that promise now given his lack of choices is to resign. Otherwise he will appear as a fraud and just another power hungry politician.
Comment 244.2	@WillCarr 91 he litreally got a worse deal than May😂😂😂 She is 10 times the politician he is...and she&#39;s a shit politician😂😂😂😂
Comment 244.3	@killbotone he&#39;s done more than May to try and hey Brexit done I respect him, the MP&#39;s are the real clowns
Comment 244.4	@WillCarr 91 Excuses Excuses Excuses. Theresa May had it a lot harder and she had to resign. This clown is hopeless, he needs to go now.
Comment 244.5	It&#39;s not his false it&#39;s corrupt parliament..his deal passed and the UK should be leaving on 31st October but ofc they denied Johnson&#39;s timetable
Comment245	Damn, that room has amazing accoustics. Either that or BBC&#39;s audio equipment is 10/10
Comment 245.1	The acoustics are so good I realised I had my headphones on the wrong way round :)
Comment 245.2	@Stuart Armstrong if you think the BBC are anti brexit or anti Tory , I&#39;ve got a bridge to sell you
Comment 245.3	@Stuart Armstrong stop pretending you have a tv license in the first place. It makes you sound stupid.
Comment 245.4	Funny how even my headphones have noise cancelling yet &#39;STOOOOP BREEXIIITT&quot; gets past thousands of pounds of audio technology....bbc, what a load of publicly funded toilet poop. err. tv license=cancelled.
Comment246	UK is doomed
Comment 246.1	Uk  is  doomed. I agree with that comment all thanks to David Cameron and the Tory Party, a prime minister who was trying to solve the split in the Tory Party over the EU, he failed, and  has already been said, said UK is doomed.
Comment 246.2	On the contrary, we have a chance to make our country intimately fairer, more successful and a better place to live in 3 simple steps:<br /><br />1.Hold a second referendum on Brexit<br />2. Vote remain<br />3. Vote Labour at the next GE.
Comment 246.3	"Friday 25th October 2019.<br /><br />Is it possible to begin CELEBRATE in 6 days<br /><b>departure</b> of our &quot;beloved&quot; SPEAKER/yeller ~&quot;ORDAAAH ORDAAAH&quot;~<br />infamous BERCOW?<br />FREEDOM from TYRANNY?<br /><br />Will POMPOUS PRETENSE by phoney MPS, noble, honourable(less), very less honourable and more,  performance like inebriated clowns end?<br />Will disease left behind, like MAD COW (Ber) cease when the air clears <br />or will case of gigantic ENCEPHALITIS<br />spreaded like MAD COW(Ber)- plague/disease in Commons continue?<br />IS <del>only</del> FULL FUMIGATION in ORDAAAAHHH?<br /><br />NATION NEEDS TO KNOW their DESTINY<br />in hands of these MAD HATTERS.<br /><br />It will be helpful if somebody can advise on<br />timely NATIONAL CELEBRATION in extreme JOY<br />once the door closes behind  &quot;beloved&quot; collaborator - with EU.<br />UNDOUBTEDLY whole UK nation will pay tribute to him.<br /><br />EU with open arms and a new promised job are awaiting his arrival.<br />SAFE TRIP BERCOW.

Comment247	For once the ghastly Keunssberg managed to keep her lefty mouth shut for a while. Good interview.
Comment248	That duplicitous, bumbling slob should bugger off into resignation. He’s an embarrassment and a shame to the U.K.  <br />We have our very own Trump. What a time to be alive. 🤢
Comment249	Laura such a skilled interviewer
Comment250	So much for the great British democratic parliamentary system.....third world countries do a better job of governing themselves
Comment 250.1	Well most of the world have a written constitution. Unfortunately the UK doesn&#39;t...
Comment251	I will vote for Boris if he wants a no deal.<br />If not then its the Brexit party for me.
Comment 251.1	Go easy on Paul Keable, everyone, he’s just discovered the word “traitor” and even managed to get Hitler into his second post. His mummy is very proud of her little lad! 👶🏻
Comment 251.2	@Lion Roar Yes you&#39;re completely right, and I&#39;m actually laughing my ass of about how &#39;Paul Keable&#39; literally said &quot;no deal is the best deal&quot;. Like... The whole idea is that it&#39;s not a deal. These salty brexiteers just get easier and easier to mock
Comment 251.3	@Paul Keable Can seriously ask you something, <br /><br />All humans are equal = EU <br />We don&#39;t want this = Brexit<br /><br />Is this correct?
Comment 251.4	@Master of None there are many reasons why no deal is the best deal.<br /><br />But all i need to say is (who needs enemies when you have friends like the EU)<br />Forget Boris and Ferege. <br />The EU have played the UK for fools with the help of a remainer parliament.<br /><br />The remainers that have twisted democracy are traitors and the EU are wolves dressed in sheeps clothing.<br />The EU is Hitlers wet dream of a 1 state Europe under 1 rule. <br />(All hail Juncker)
Comment 251.5	Why do u want a no deal? <b>russians by sting plays in the background</b>
Comment252	Boris is great... globalist cue failing
Comment253	Has the EU agreed to this extension if not we should leave next week
Comment 253.1	They can hold an emergency summit on the morning of the 31st if they wanted. Also leaving without a deal is worse than just staying in
Comment254	They are taking the piss.
Comment255	There is a great difference. Trump has less hairs on his head but he takes good care of his hairs. Boris has a good deal of hairs on his head but he can&#39;t even be bothered to comb them. <br /><br />If Boris can&#39;t even take good care of his hairs, can he be expected to take good care of the UK and people?
Comment 255.1	Adam Of Eve <br /><br />He tussles his hair deliberately to cover up his thinning crown <br /><br />He&#39;s got much less hair than Stan, his father .
Comment256	Absolutely shambles just like boris hair
Comment 256.1	At Least he has hair your probably some bald headed thug who can&#39;t get laid
Comment 256.2	Sick of Bojo hair jokes.Have a laugh at footballers hair, say those with top buns like Gareth Bale.
Comment 256.3	Lmao
Comment257	So no more 31st oktober no deal exit ? that was fast change of tune.<br />Oh yeah election coming up and 16 million remainers going to vote for another referendum to remain.<br />The tory party can fight it out with the brexit party for a No deal Exit or Deal Exit.<br />Let see both Tory and Brexit no comment we just want out... liars like always.
Comment 257.1	Boris your a fraud
Comment 257.2	@Drake Hound If they aren&#39;t legally bounding, why bother to have a referendum? Isn&#39;t Labour&#39;s policy presently is to have another non bounding referendum?
Comment 257.3	@Ron Clark Cause a Referendum isn´t LEGALLY BINDING.<br />So go chase the people who ran away instead of honoring the referendum.<br />Cameron and Farage. <br /><br /><br />So here we are going for round 2 cause you do believe in 2nd chances. think carefully.<br />Cause karma is listening if you answer wrong.
Comment 257.4	There won&#39;t be another referendum. Why have a second one when the first one wasn&#39;t honored by the Remainders.... FACT....
Comment258	Don&#39;t trust him, they gonna damage the economy, maybe you think you don&#39;t care, but tomorrow or later in my opinion everyone will care about but it will be late.
Comment 258.1	@Ron Clark  China is a super power . You are a tiny island economy living in the past and dreaming of the past . What exactly do you manufacture nowadays ?  Apart from chaos of course
Comment 258.2	@pat dunne Is China a member of the EU? No it isn&#39;t. Does China have a free trade agreement with the EU? No it doesn&#39;t. If the EU ships to China, there is a tariff. When China ships to the EU, there is a tariff. Is China hurt by not being a member of the EU?  Apparently not...
Comment 258.3	@Ron Clark It is , but then again China is not stupid enough to withdraw from its biggest market and then  beg to get deals to fill that massive gap elsewhere. That is a level of stupidity only the English enjoy.
Comment 258.4	@pat dunne The world marketplace is wonderful... Where did that smart phone, tablet, or computer you used to comment here come from? Most likely Asia, probably China... Isn&#39;t world commerce great?
Comment 258.5	@Ron Clark Yea sure . Where do you think your UK is going  after removing itself from the worlds largest economic block ?. Ogh the stupidity  .Good luck as Donalds plaything
Comment259	<b>Fuck</b> December the 12th Boris make it so that we leave in 6 days otherwise there will be a media shitstorm coming your way I guarantee or you will receive the amount of hate the likes of which a politician has not seen since the reign of Thatcher
Comment260	We do not need a general election now. what we need is a new referendum on leaving or stay base on the plan to exit.-England is asking to respect it&#39;s vote to leave. Scotland also is asking for it&#39;s vote to remain in the  EU to be respected too .--let us not be hypocrit give Scotland his right too.
Comment261	Great PM can’t wait to vote for u in a general election
Comment262	Beware of BBC my dear PM Boriz.
Comment263	Never mind an election . What should be happening is a VALID Referendum . The first Referendum was rushed through at a point in time when the vast majority had little or in fact no knowledge of the ramifications of BREXIT . NOW and only NOW  after an untold number of documentaries , discussions etc. etc. etc. can a rational decision be made about BREXIT.<br />2nd Referendum 2nd Referendum            If another election is doable then surely another Referendum is more easily doable . And don&#39;t give me any hollow trite claims about &quot;honoring&quot; the choice the people have made . Because if that is the case then &quot;honor&quot; the choice they made in the last election ... you don&#39;t need a new one .
Comment264	Hope Boris has something up his sleeve to leave on the 31st of October or he&#39;s done for along with Labour, SNP and Lib Dem, get rid of them all.
Comment 264.1	the chance of leaving by october 31st, I would say is under 5%
Comment265	Ish... how many elections do u need lol waste money n time.
Comment 265.1	@Ron Clark Fake  pools. Same polls show over 50% now want to remain in the EU.
Comment 265.2	The polls presently show Labour could lose over one hundred seats.... It will be good business if the Tories got half that number in a snap election....
Comment266	BBC, please fire Laura, once and for all. She doesn&#39;t listen and is disrespectful of our PM.
Comment 266.1	The BBC put her there to answer those questions.
Comment267	A true question to anyone in the UK, are your ballots for elections or referendums and such, are they paper ballots or do some take on electronic ballot voting? I ask because it is difficult to find accurate, trustworthy information on this. Thanks for any response.
Comment 267.1	Sophie Maria Absintheve there is no online voting in the U.K. they are all paper ballots either in a polling booth or postal ballots.
Comment 267.2	@Sophie Maria Absintheve I am having difficulty with this replying stuff, please forgive me if I made a mistake and I do want you to know that I sincerely thank you for responding.  If a portion of balloting is electronic, you are in as much danger as the Americans have in our elections. The internet is programmed in a binary format, and as was proven by one of those think tank kind of things, a 12 year old girl was able to bypass all the firewalls and break into the Florida voting information with less than a day of effort. The Ukraine was up for NATO/OTAN membership, but was invaded. Finland was thinking of joining, but Putin sent a very serious threat to them. Sweden is having an up tic in bombing, but they are having their media relabel such events, Germany is having a rash of right wing, then anti right wing protests, and Spain is dealing with a province that is trying to break away. Add to this that the US has a president deep in financial debt to the Russian oligarchs, basically turning the US into a Vichy state and now the UK is trying to break away from the EU. I fear that the FSB is doing as the KGB used to, trigger events then fan the flames that leap up. At the end of WW2, the Allies and Finland were the only reasons Stalin didn&#39;t attempt to conquer Europe. I think that most I have written of is a plot to break up the EU, thus the effectiveness of NATO/OTAN, so that Putin can do what his hero dreamed of.
Comment 267.3	online too
Comment 267.4	daguard411 paper ballots

Comment269	Lot of losses for Johnson. His opposition was smart to wait for an election because they got exactly what they wanted so never listen to him say &quot;no balls&quot; to them when calling for an election . . . .

Comment 272.1	ken peters <br /><br />Human rights like blowing up a million Iraqis ?...or human rights like locking up Julian Assange ? Those human rights ?
Comment 272.2	The same would apply with both advocating the same as separate entities as well.... Your logic doesn&#39;t make sense....
Comment273	Am I the only person that see he is lieing in this interview?
Comment274	I support Brexit as a Socialist but that man will destroy Britain just like Thatcher did before him. Its like reliving the nightmare of suffering. And it will be the poorest who suffer most. Tory voters should be ashamed.
Comment 274.1	If you really do support brexit...You&#39;re not a socialist...Get a grip....Try THINKING!!!
Comment275	Brexit has gone out of control and no body knows what to do or where to go anymore, you have lost the trust of the British public, END OF. Bad leadership always keeps on fighting each other.
Comment276	You&#39;ve made your bed Boris, now you get to lie in it with the rest of us. You shouldn&#39;t be allowed to just skulk off after the shitstorm you helped create.
Comment277	Laura Kuenssberg is the worst thing to happen to Europe since the black death.

Comment279	RIP Boris and Jeremy if Brexit was not happened also Labour and Tories.
Comment 279.1	Can you rephrase that?
Comment280	Boris during his campaign: &quot;Do or die!&quot; <br />Boris now: &quot;do or die? ...let&#39;s just abandon cake and do pie!&quot;<br /><br />So instead of leaving Boris has now closed the door to that option. Do or die is now &#39;door, die!&#39; apparently.
Comment 280.1	@Brexit Buccaneer Nothing that I care of but have a good day you too. Good manners are always there to save the day.
Comment 280.2	@Santiago Valencia<br /><br />I completely disagree with your view regarding Boris.  100%<br /><br />Thanks for sharing it.<br /><br />Have a good day.
Comment 280.3	@Brexit Buccaneer I fully agree Corbyn is s complete hypocrite, however Boris is fully responsible for the situation he&#39;s in.<br /><br />Or he&#39;s a complete idiot (that I do not think this is the case) or he should have known one cannot attack those one needs to pass the agreement, hold a new general election, avoid stupid amendments, etc.<br /><br />In my view Boris is acting in a selfish that doesn&#39;t really matter what goes or stay as far as he has what he wants, lying to the queen included if he finds it necessary for his goals...that, of course, does not include resigning as that would mean the end of his fantasy.<br /><br />Like May at the beginning, he&#39;s no more than another unelected burocrat thinking about himself and no one else.
Comment 280.4	@Jarl Mos Leaving without a deal cannot be stopped completely, despite anything else that is decided. He said he would prefer to enf up in a ditch than changing route but apparently all ditches are taken now that if he would do that it would be the end of his political career. He&#39;s learned long time ago that using your tongue and being loyal to what you say are two very different things.<br /><br />Boris is now acting as the brat he has always been, a spoilt child which only focus is himself and changes goal, intermediate targets and routes as and when it&#39;s covinient for him, independently on how that impact others.<br /><br />He&#39;s not a victim, he&#39;s worst than May as he promised things so extreme that he knew he wasn&#39;t going to be able to do them since day one.
Comment 280.5	@Jarl Mos <br />That&#39;s the spin and lies he and Cummings successful, <br />Put all over you...<br />Why doesn&#39;t Nigel pretend with recooked May&#39;s deal with meaningless amendment that he&#39;s done it, <br />Go research how restricted it is, <br />It&#39;s why it failed when may tried to pass it.
Comment281	Boris ! Is that an English name ?<br />It look like Russian.<br />Hey Boris even your brother run away from you, you should run to, to Borisland.
Comment282	we have trump..you have boris  scary self serving hypocrites
Comment283	Ok FIRE AT WILL
Comment 283.1	Democracy &amp; Human Right<br /><br />Oil &amp; Gas
Comment284	Boris look .you will need to change your mind asap.<br />Forget the whispers of  (Dominic  conning. ) If you know what I mean..<br /><br />This Government is ignoring the voices of millions of people who are saying no to lies. and we want a  final say on Brexit. But the Government totaly ignoring people. Also ignorant about how leave won Brexit vote. This Government is  concerned about  survival and winning votes to build a majority if the win next general election.  <br /><br />By turning extreme they think they will get more brexiters voted next time.<br />But the  interest of country in hall isn&#39;t a priority <br /><br />Their general election campaign began long time ago since Boris won his PM seat they started promising people things labour promised them before. ..also they started promising things which are well over due. .but some people don&#39;t have clue just getting excited about it.<br /><br />The promised Brexit by end OCTOBER too.also still blackmailing people with a no deal card.<br /><br />The only way out of this total mess. Is to allow people to vote on May&#39;s salvaged deal.a no deal or the existing deal.<br />Beacuse a general election will not fix Brexit  process problems.. It could go on for years as long a  Government don&#39;t have a massive majority. <br /><br />The EU and the UK  can&#39;t wait forever to conclude Brexit process. <br /><br />So Boris could end all this mess in weeks time then no need for a general election for some time.Specially  rigth now he hase good few labour MPs loyal to him more than their own party. The voted for the deal and the queen speech. Surprising many.<br /><br />Boris could simply call for people vote no matter what result the tories will still be in until 2022 if they wish..<br />All the other parties will not even think of avotes of no confidence in years to come if Boris go for peoples vote. <br /><br />If the majority of the British are for hard Brexit as the majority of Tories and all Brexit party claim.Then why not wanting to confirm it with people&#39;s vote. Then people will have to accept it because Brexit is much more clearer and understood even school  kids are very familiar with it.<br /><br />Boris call for peoples vote asap.forget about  general election. You could still be short of seats if you win. Or the others may win but also with not enough seat .<br /><br />Brexit mess could go on for good. Boris  no deal is the end of the tories and the brake up of the union.<br />Just let people have a say on how to leave the EU or if they changed their minds.<br />People do change their minds before completion. <br />Some leave and remain remain surely changed their minds after 3years of learning about Brexit. Now is the perfect time to allow people&#39;s vote.
Comment 284.1	@George Sano I agree..but whe  some big lies like Brexiting  with Norway style soft Brexit  ..350 millions NHS. Come on that&#39;s piss taking...and people believe it<br />.
Comment 284.2	Or you could have done your own research?<br /><br />Every election/referendum has some basis in falsehood/ignorance since hindsight is 20/20. Don&#39;t blame them for your inability to do your own research.
Comment 284.3	@George Sano look we voted after hearing lies.<br />No one could just ignore or dismiss this fact. Unless if they are totally ignorant.
Comment 284.4	@Nigel Kipling no need to say sorry..but those extremists will be sorry when their lives becomes even worse with a hard Brexit.  We shouldn&#39;t be ignorant of the serious risks no one voted for.
Comment285	You can almost smell the bullshit.
Comment286	Winner get it done
Comment287	Boris Bashing Cons at it again. Just get us out of this dictatorship.
Comment 287.1	The real dictatorship, is the ERG, less than 100, who David Cameron keeled over to...Destroying the &quot;United Kingdom&quot;....British democracy is all about, having an election every five years,,,NOT about brexit types wanting their ignorant opinion to last for EVER!
Comment288	Clown
Comment289	If MPs wanna study, ask them go back to school!! Brexit definitely will change UK, 100% there will have economic impact and must take it else how to move on? Else be sure to win the GE
Comment290	Why is Johnson whinging about the fact that parliament wants to examine the bill when he illegally porogued parliamentary scrutiny. Yet despite all the contradictory evidence why are the Tories still blaming Labour for all the ills of the current of this Tory despite having led the country for the last nine years of doing so. Incredulous.

Comment305	Corbyn says no.............. cough
Comment306	#1 A General Election has absolutely no bearing on whether or not Parliament accepts the current withdrawal bill.<br /><br />#2 I&#39;ll vote for anybody who puts date and month in the correct order ... As well as the party offering the public a final say.
Comment 306.1	@Yoruichi The Extra Terrestrial The opinions were always clarified. People voted for leave. Not leave with a deal, not maybe leave in 4 years when we have more information. Leave.
Comment 306.2	@Alex Spray It has nothing to do with &#39;liking the result of the referendum&#39;, it&#39;s asking whether the public should be involved in the final decision, based on the options which have only just been clarified.<br /><br />I don&#39;t know how to explain it any more simply. If democracy is at a basic level, the will of the people, and there is a question mark over what the will of the people is, democracy says you go and find out.
Comment 306.3	@Yoruichi The Extra Terrestrial The problem is that you would be eroding the principles of how our democracy works because you don&#39;t like the result of the referendum.
Comment 306.4	@Alex Spray If you think nobody&#39;s changed their minds, what&#39;s the problem?
Comment 306.5	@Yoruichi The Extra Terrestrial As I said before you would invalidate the first result, which is factually democratically mandated, based upon the subjective opinion that the public may have changed their minds. Besides, the public haven&#39;t changed their minds from the election polls I&#39;ve seen... but we will see! Polls are never accurate.
Comment307	He’s a crook ... selling out the UK to Trump ... and corporate interests.
Comment308	Quick, look over there. Don&#39;t look at the ditch I&#39;m going to die in. Oh, and can someone buy the slovenly fellow a comb please?
Comment309	"Nigel Farage for PM. BoJo&#39;s a remainer.<br />General election. Remember 1381.<br />Nigel Farage for PM. He&#39;s the only hope for Brexit.<br />Just renounce the treaty as of 29 March 2019. No need for anything from Brussels bureaucrats. No need for Article 50. UK is a sovereign nation.<br />Just renounce it."
Comment 309.1	@Mr Olsen The UK is not being ruled with the consent of the governed.
Comment 309.2	Grow up, start to look at fact, when you have left you will see wages go down and food go up, most WTO countries do not pay workers much, if they get a job for the day then they are lucky to earn 5 £ for a long day, why should i buy more expensive items from the UK when i can get it tax free in the EU, why on earth do you think it is good to pay tariff, a tariff that will kill business in the UK, 50 % export goes to the EU, US take 25 %, the rest of the world takes the rest, if you are lucky  half your jobs in the UK will survive this, do you really want to fight for a job, what are you willing to work for when the other guy will do it cheaper than you ?
Comment310	Squeaky clean bum time for Labour.
Comment311	Boris👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻
Comment 311.1	@Mr Olsen The corrupt EU is undemocratic. Britain will regain its sovereignty from EU tyranny.
Comment 311.2	And post brexit you will work for less when someone who want your job can do it cheaper, maybe a guy from Pakistan or India, or why not just send your job over to them it is much cheaper, do you really want to work for 5 £ a day ?, it will become reality post brexit, people around the world will take your job, only 8 countries in the world can keep up with EU and they are much smaller and then the US, what do you think they will pay for NHS ?
Comment312	I&#39;m glad they&#39;re not getting out on October 31st. That is a satanic holiday
Comment 312.1	Pagans didnt value the individual autonomy.    They sacrificed thousands of humans.   Christians respect that each individual has God inside them and only sacrificed Jesus to end all human sacrifice.
Comment 312.2	@Daughter of Enoch not an argument a debate I find it entertaining, what part of paganism is satanic?
Comment 312.3	Matt Stevens <br /><br />You want this argument real bad don&#39;t you, heathen soul ? 😉<br /><br />Go on then. Post some more of your Stonehenge swagger. <br /><br />We listening
Comment 312.4	@Daughter of Enoch you don&#39;t know do you lol
Comment 312.5	👀 🙄
Comment313	This DEAL is never binding in international law, and would lock us into a european treaty   which we already have, and which will be binding in international law;  our government will not be able to  pass a law without  european parliament approval.....to put it another way ...we will be governed by the european parliament, as we are now; that was the point of brexit in the first place---to break all ties with them, and to give back governance to the UK parliament.
Comment 313.1	Based on how Parliament has been performing since 2015, I&#39;m gonna guess that the UK would be better off with the European Parliament, lmao
Comment314	Trump Mafia Wizards for morning NY coffees 🐷🐷
Comment315	👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻😂😂😂😍
Comment316	The muppet should Resign now, because there&#39;s no way he can get it done by 31st October ! And he did say &quot;DO OR DIE&quot;
Comment 316.1	@the faceless Vaper Yes and he meant it. He was dedicated to leaving on 31st with or without a deal. Unfortunately the remainers have blocked it and forced him in law to get an extension. And now they&#39;re seriously considering denying a GE just to hold the government hostage because they know they wouldn&#39;t win it one yet.<br /><br />I&#39;m sad to see that Labour&#39;s front bench strategy of &quot;make em fail then blame em&quot; has worked on you though.
Comment 316.2	@Anonymous <br />No I voted leave in 2016. I&#39;m just getting pissed off with all these damn politicians playing games with our lives ! And he did say do or die.
Comment 316.3	@Captain Cook lol. You have to put sarc at the end so the stupid people know
Comment 316.4	@the faceless Vaper Replace our wonderful country with islam...sharia law for everyone. Because it works so wonderfully well in moslem countries.
Comment 316.5	You&#39;re so scared of this general election, are you praying he&#39;ll resign because you&#39;ve stopped us leaving? xD
Comment317	I prefer to die in a ditch rather than not doing the brexit , said boris !!
Comment 317.1	"@laser325 <br /><br />yes <a href=""https://youtu.be/TDCAxuiZLPw"">https://youtu.be/TDCAxuiZLPw</a>"
Comment 317.2	He said he would rather die in a ditch than ask the EU for an extension.<br />He didn&#39;t mention &#39;not doing Brexit...&#39;
Comment 317.3	@The Last Spartan People shouldn&#39;t make promises their arse can&#39;t keep. People in power, even more so. You can deflect all you want, but this one is one Boris. It is like me promising you a million pounds but breaking that promise because those pesky rats at the lottery didn&#39;t select my numbers.
Comment 317.4	@The Last Spartan Corbyn is actually a Brexiteer <br />And Boris is actually a remainer and a filthy liar, <br />Who wants to be elected, <br />Nigel Farage is true. <br />Boris will f you just as he f&#39;d many of his loved ones before, <br />With Cummings all over him he just appears attractive to you, <br />Wait till his betrayal comes again.
Comment 317.5	true he said that, but corbyn the traitor has made it impossible by law with all  his crazy rats that are under his and the EU&#39;s control have made brexit impossible !!! <br /><br />its time to kick old man steptoe and his rats out of Parliament and claim back our country from the political invasion by the eu, being helped and support by the labour parry
Comment318	He sets the date when the election is, haha, he want at all cost to make Britain little US, he can sell NHS, it will still be NHS just on insurance based system, help for the poor will be gone, he also promised he would die in a ditch if you did not leave on the 31th, he lies all the time, just ask all who knows him haha, you on the Island in the North Sea are in big big problems, if you think poverty in Britain is bad  then just wait until brexit then you will see poverty, De Gaulle said if Britain comes in the common marked then Boris will come and make trouble...
Comment319	BoJos treaty is actually dangerous check Brexbox , it ties us even more with the EU as we loose our say and they still call the shots.   Read it.    Only way out is No Deal
Comment320	Kick this psodo-Trump out !
Comment321	This time, BBC reporter is right about going through the proper process. But then voters are stupid. Especially white british brexiteers are stupid
Comment322	So lets look at Lauras option by &quot;going through it line by line&quot;.  You dont need to be a rocket scientist to work out this ends with Corbyn saying  &quot;workers rights, environment, chlorinated chicken and Trump trade deal blah blah blah&quot;.  After they have changed it  beyond recognition Boris has to go back to Brussels and renegotiate again.  NO!   Boris is right,   we need an election and labour can go get fucked.
Comment 322.1	@FuckILoveYouTubby This bill has differences to May&#39;s deal, (which also was even more damaging the Boris&#39;s) so even if it is similar, it&#39;s still unacceptable. The more similar to May&#39;s deal this one is, the MORE scrutiny it should receive before being passed. The leave campaign has become blind and wreckless and will damage the country in order to get their way. We need more consideration not more speed
Comment 322.2	Pablo Galbraith no you’re wrong.   it’s the same bill as mays less the backstop.  Labour have had ample time to go over it.  All labour want is delay.
Comment 322.3	No, you&#39;re wrong. Rushing this bill is hugely irresponsible and will impact this country for years to come. Going through it line by line is the only way to ensure that Brexit is carried out fairly and nobody is left behind. Scrutiny from labour is essential to make sure that the bill causes as little economic damage as possible
Comment323	Best interview
Comment324	Doris u are a loser.👈👀
Comment325	She&#39;s talking for the Labour party. What boris Johnson is offering is perfectly reasonable. I can&#39;t wait for the general election, I can&#39;t wait to get rid of this waste of Turkey undemocratic MP&#39;s in parliament!
Comment326	Like him or not at least the PM has the gumption to take it to the people. Corbyn knows he will get destroyed in a GE so is running scared, the Labour communist party belong in the scrapheap along with all the other EU fanatics and traitors.
Comment 326.1	patient zero there you are with those buzzwords again. The bill passed second reading, meaning it still has several stages to go before it can become law. It still needs another vote by the House and Lords, and that isn&#39;t going to happen because Johnson refused a reasonable timetable.<br /><br />So as of right now, there is no deal in place.
Comment 326.2	@Jock Duff The House has voted in  favour of passing the bill this is what labour wanted a deal, they don&#39;t need to worry about no deal anymore.  If labour is so worried about transition periods then Labour is free to campaign as part of their election campaign. <br /><br />Its up to the democratic will of the people, not a few members of parliament something labour and remainers know little about.
Comment 326.3	@patient zero If the deal is not passed then no deal is not off the table. Hell, readings of the bill suggest no deal may not be off the table even if it is passed, as ministers may be able to push no deal after a transition period has ended in 2021/2022. Hence why people wanted more time for the bill to be looked at.<br /><br /><br />There is no truth to your statement, just lazy buzzwords you use in place of actually having a credible argument.
Comment 326.4	@Jock Duff The deal was put through I never wrote &quot;passed&quot;.  This means no deal is off the table.  Labour are stalling and running out of ideas. its hard to take seriously remoners taking the moral high ground on democracy when they call to scrap Article 50 altogether.  Yes they are traitors, truth hurts.

Comment329	Yes, December 12 is my birthday (makes as much sense as anything out of Boris &amp; company).
Comment 329.1	Maybe he speaks Russian...
Comment 329.2	Ray Bod same, birthday bros
Comment330	She might of well been the Labour party interviewing him. All the words the Labour party use &#39;ramming it through&#39;. The BBC Biased channel at its best. So far left it&#39;s untrue
Comment 330.1	Actually it is true.  It&#39;s not at all normal for a huge bill like this to go through in 2 days.  Normally it should take weeks.
Comment331	Boris.  you need to take us out on the 31st.  you are embarrassing yourself.
Comment 331.1	@Anonymous Article 48. ERROR1. A State may invoke an error in a  treaty as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty if the error relates to a  fact or situation which was assumed by that State to exist at the time when the treaty was concluded and formed an essential basis of its consent to be bound by the treaty<br />     .2. Paragraph 1  shall not apply if the State in question contributed by its own conduct to the error or if the circumstances were such as to put that State on notice of a possible error.3. An error relating only to the wording of the text of a treaty does not affect its validity; article 79 then applies.<br />    Article 49. FRAUDIf a  State has been induced to conclude a  treaty by the fraudulent conduct of another negotiating State, the State may invoke the fraud as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty.<br />    Article 50. CORRUPTION OF A  REPRESENTATIVE OF A  STATE If the expression of a State&#39;s consent to be bound by a treaty has been procured through the corruption of its representative directly or indirectly by another negotiating State, the State may invoke such corruption as invalidating its consent to be bound by the treaty<br />      .Article 51. COERCION OF A  REPRESENTATIVE OF A  STATE The expression of a State&#39;s consent to be bound by a treaty which has been pro cured by the coercion of its representative through acts or threats directed against him shall be without any legal effect.
Comment 331.2	@bo ptah<br />The Benn surrender act might end up working in his favour at this election.
Comment 331.3	@bo ptah<br />What does A51 Vienna treaty do?<br />And if Boris does secretly want a delay then it&#39;s because he&#39;s built up all this anticipation only for this toxic remainer parliament to keep us in again. <br /><br />So he can build support and fuel frustration among leavers and even some remainers, &quot;they stopped me&quot; on his side at the GE.
Comment 331.4	@Anonymous  Boris does not have to abide by the Surrender Act.  He can invoke Article 51 of the Vienna treaty.  It is obvious that the traitors in Parliament are trying to stop him.
Comment 331.5	You realise there&#39;s basically nothing he can legally do. Or do you just want an excuse to turn to Farage?
Comment332	Why is Laura always interviewing or to be more acurate why is she his PR spin doctor??
Comment 332.1	She can&#39;t resist a slice of Boris&#39; Pecker, that&#39;s why!!
Comment333	My prediction of a general election result will be an overwhelming landslide by the brexit party pushing the Tories into opposition and Labour with lib Dems are gunno become extinct in the Commons
Comment 333.1	Wishful thinking I fear a pact between the torys and the Brexit party is the only sure way of preventing another hung parliament or even worse a Corbin led government my view obviously really hope I don’t get to say told you so
Comment 333.2	Does it not bother you that the Brexit party has no policies? My prediction is that their manifesto will be even further right than the Tories. So unless you&#39;re really into austerity and keen to see your employment rights ripped up I&#39;d consider putting your X elsewhere.
Comment 333.3	So a party that at its best polled in the low 20s is suddenly going to wipe everyone away with the Tories becoming the official opposition even though the Tories and Brexit party are competing for the same voters while Labour and the Lib Dems are largely trying to attract different votes? Yea, you haven&#39;t got a clue what you&#39;re talking about.
Comment 333.4	@Pat Mccarron <br />Time will tell
Comment334	Thing is there all shit options
Comment335	Soooooooooooooo...... No brexit again?.....
Comment 335.1	The logical reason why...Is that only revoking article 50 makes any sense...Brexit is the realm of the uninformed and hence, ignorant...Easily brainwashed by the mentally ill...........FARAGE, the front man and his supporters, all Multi-millionaires, looking to increase their GREED!
Comment336	Yeah parliament voted......... But the EU still hasnt changed their position since Theresa Mays first visit. She kept coming back with deals that got rejected and now its Boris turn to have a go at it, but the EU has made up their mind. Take it or leave it. The UK will take whats on offer or crash and burn out of the EU with no deal. Tough shit. Meanwhile Brits seem to think THEY have any cards to play in this game. Or that they are actually in a game at all. They arent. There IS no deal to be found in this. None that comes out favorable for Britain. Why on earth would the EU accept a kick in the balls and let you get away with it favorably ??
Comment 336.1	@Janusha shut  up u prick its got fuck all eh do. Way me knowing fuck all a no a don&#39;t wanty b In The EU and  were payin  them a billion  a month. For it and  they. Make the rules and charge us  for it go fuck ya self ya slave we joined to  trade. Not to b part. Of ur. Eu empire and y u giving it the immigration card how the fuck do u know y we voted the way we did it was for. Self. Governing u thick prick that was my reason
Comment 336.2	@John farrell <br />Haha thats the talk of people who dont understand how this whole EU thing works. Thats dinner table talk. Or farm-yard and building-site-talk. We pay 350 million to the EU a week, they say. And were aint gettin ought back... This has been explained and debunked hundred times in media. But people believe what they want to believe.<br /><br />And this is why EU membership shouldnt be put out to public vote. Because YOU, your aunt and your friends dont know SHIT about international trade deals, unions or politics. What you, the flagwaving masses, vote for are immediate things like... Will cigarettes or fuel for my car become 50p cheaper if we leave the EU. Yes? Then lets leave.<br /><br />But its not about cigarettes or fuel, is it. Its about immigration. While you dont know shit about international trade deals, you do know that you dont like that Polish family living in that council house at the end of the street, and you think voting Britain out of the EU will mean there are less of those, right. Well thats bullshit too. This whole thing is bullshit.<br /><br />Brexit really is Englands Donald Trump.
Comment 336.3	Y should  the UK be governed. By  the EU and pay billions for it ya pleb out clean deal then they will want to talk trade. Deals keep ur surrender treaty
Comment337	Borris just needs to stick to his guns and take us out the 31st..
Comment 337.1	@McMilk I know pal.. it&#39;s just frustrating hearing words like we will be leaving and then we are not.. we got a deal,now we arent sure if it&#39;s getting voted.. it&#39;s getting silly and im finding parliament a embarrassment to our country. Also we are now waiting to hear on E.U for another extension.. No respect for the vote in 2016, I do appreciate that remainers are fighting for what they think is right but they need to realise if table was turnt would this all be going the same way.. I doubt it. We would be silenced and it would be forgotten about till the next big headline like Katie price is having another child with a 18yr old 😱  alot of lives are being destroyed because of this and it pisses me off they will now spend millions on campaigns for a G.E but there&#39;s food banks with hardly any food kids dying on the streets etc.. it&#39;s a disgrace
Comment 337.2	@Agent Smith see what happens if I do I do.. and if I don&#39;t I don&#39;t 👌
Comment 337.3	@Itzhak Vögél I hear that..
Comment 337.4	English Budz He can’t do anything without a majority support from the house

Comment 338.3	It is inevitable
Comment 338.4	Yes, isn&#39;t it great that they created a whole party for complete morons.  If you want you can even send them £25 for champagne and lobster whilst you lose your job.
Comment339	This is your BEST polític . great britain is caput .

Comment341	we in this mess because of bojo and farage selling the country a lie, if only we believe, the reality is , we will break up are country and destory what we have, for nothing
Comment 341.1	@Mr Olsen what happened to those poor or middle class brexiteers, die in the ditch? Nobody especially Tories has been talking about how to upgrade or transform the skillsets of these folks. One can&#39;t expect to do the same jobs forever
Comment 341.2	@looes74 looes74 People will work for nothing post brexit, why have anything made in the UK when you can get some in Pakistan or India to do the work much cheaper...
Comment 341.3	@samwright Do u want try again with that sentence.
Comment 341.4	@Mr Olsen The beauty is that even when things point south, they will just grit their teeth and embrace hell. Reminds of male black widow spider at the end of mating process. Which is extremely sad. The point is those who doesn&#39;t believe in brexit have their life destroyed as well. Hence one begin to wonder if democracy is really the right process in running policies. Humans are so easily manipulated
Comment 341.5	@the faceless Vaper Nah........hang one by one. Start by hanging Nigel Farage
Comment342	I give up.. Britain is lost.
Comment 342.1	Sadly true.........Many ignorant halfwits, with the IQ of a Cabbage.......Also known as Brexiteers, don&#39;t care,,,Self destruction is OK for them....Fuhrer Farage told them so:::D
Comment 342.2	But it will be nice with all those jobs in EU, it will bring up payment for workers...
Comment343	Oh look the remoner bbc has allowed comments for this video leave the eu NOW
Comment 343.1	Little US or Trumpland, UK is fucked post brexit, the IRA has already said trouble is coming, and if they do as they say then no trade with the US...
Comment 343.2	Very clever
Comment344	Can someone British with a straight head clarify Boris for me?<br />Is he like Trump?
Comment 344.1	@Brexit Buccaneer Donald continues to be Donald....A fading mental health?...An intelligent Yank? Guns galore, the American response to ANY situation........Child like!
Comment 344.2	Brexit Buccaneer Have you followed the news, like at all? His approval ratings are below 20. Support for his impeachment is above 55. He’s anti climate change, and pro dictator. He’s being investigated for criminal charges. He won’t win
Comment 344.3	@Owen C he won 2016 against all the odds, pundits, CNN, hillary, Obama mocked for even putting forward as a candidate.<br /><br />He will win 2020 also.
Comment345	Brexiteers... how’s that vote working out for you? Strong and stable, do or die, dead in a ditch... rule Britannia!!!!!
Comment 345.1	I want Boris........To be DEAD in a DITCH...LOL
Comment 345.2	Looking good, following democracy. It&#39;s a shame the politicians who&#39;s majority constituents voted to leave have gone against what the voted for. Labour are finished, hence why they don&#39;t want a GE. Great to see you go along with democracy
Comment 345.3	Fine thanks, you? In case you didn&#39;t notice, a deal passed in Parliament, and brexit is now in the process of being implemented. The country is strong and stable - provided the SNP don&#39;t bugger it up for everyone.
Comment346	he&#39;s a tool
Comment 346.1	Not a very useful one at that.
Comment 346.2	Shut up kid, adults talking.
Comment347	Another definite &quot;do or die!&quot; moment?. I feel sorry for the Brits.
Comment 347.1	Feel sorry for yourself! Britons will be just fine, even better outside the EU!
Comment 347.2	Feel sorry for yourself, we&#39;re fine.
Comment 347.3	Why? We&#39;ve been dealing with incompetence of this kind for the last 50 years.
Comment348	Boris is clearly letting his Hedge Fund backers down because he has combed his hair !!!      What a con artist.
Comment 348.1	California Dreamin&#39; for the vast majority of people, Brexit is about sovereignty. And democracy. And a sensible security-balanced immigration policy. And being free to make better trade deals around the globe.
Comment 348.2	Tom Maj      We will find out soon who they are , when the EU get their teeth into them over tax evasion.  That is what Brexit is all about.
Comment 348.3	California Dreamin&#39; whatever side you’re on has plenty of hedge fund backers too and their ilk.
Comment 348.4	Agent Smith       He is clearly desperate.   I&#39;ll give him credit though because he is certainly full of it ,  and I&#39;m not talking about kippers.
Comment 348.5	He only combs it for elections.
Comment349	The PM aged like 5 years since he took office
Comment 349.1	NO! He&#39;s returned to a place of comfort...An infant classroom , flogging his wares to 5 year old&#39;s...:::D
Comment 349.2	Most likely the Brexit party, the one that truly represents the people.
Comment 349.3	They always do - look at Blair or Obummer in America.
Comment 349.4	They always do - look at Blair or Obummer in America.
Comment350	It&#39;s all fairly standard and obvious stuff. Boris is playing pure party politics. He knows what makes the opposition look bad and how to present that to the public. He knows that the opposition are trying to find any way to stall him and defame him, even if that means making up new laws ex post facto. So of course he&#39;s pushing to move things faster. He&#39;s playing the populist card of getting the job done while Labour dither. And Labour HAVE dithered a LOT - especially when they should have been proposing valid and considered alternatives.
Comment 350.1	There are no valid alternatives. Brexit must go ahead because the people voted for it; it is the only democratic thing to do. There will then always be a problem at the Irish border because of the Good Friday agreement, which essentially requires no border. So there has to be some form of backstop, or an arrangement like the one Boris is proposing in any deal.<br /><br />It&#39;s easy to make the opposition look bad when they don&#39;t have a leg to stand on, that&#39;s why they refused a general election twice ;)
Comment351	BREXIT MEANS BRREXIT ,BOTH MEAN NOTHING TO PEOPLE BUT A DISGUSTING TEATHER DISPLAY OF PARLIAMENTARY DEMOCRACY AND FALSEFLAG PARTISAN DISPUTES , AND IN PRACTICE FOLLOWING CAUSE OF THE ROYALTY OF BRITIAN ,BREXIT ITSELF
Comment352	Over confidence make you careless
Comment353	Bring the Election and if its a Pro-Brexit Majority then it&#39;s a United Ireland and a Free Republic of Scotland. If it&#39;s a Pro-European then it&#39;s an end for this circus. Either way, amazing things are coming. It&#39;s a win-win situation!!! ;-)
Comment 353.1	@Anonymous I answered all of your stupid &quot;questions&quot; you answered no one cause you are a pathetic fascist troll. Have no more time to spend on you prick. Bye bye! 😂
Comment 353.2	@Anonymous My luck of argument? Hahahaha your stupidity is endless. A troll which has a problem to accept what Democracy is and still calls for Democracy is the very definition of hypocrisy and makes me laugh but you have no arguments at all and keep repeating the same crap. PS: Says the one who can&#39;t even write &quot;guarantee&quot;. Typical uneducated, fascist, Brexshit troll. Same old sad story!
Comment 353.3	@geoforamorio<br />You&#39;re actually the saddest person I&#39;ve ever come across on here. Your a perfect Remainer example. Your lack of argument for anything, the level of arrogance, hypocrisy, denial and your endless delusions have remind me why we&#39;re gonna have to finish you maniacs off in December.<br /><br />I&#39;m utterly convinced you are not even a fellow British citizen. How could you be? You really are just some sad EU troll.<br /><br />Your endless emojis and constant name calling &quot;facists&quot; &quot;idiots&quot; etc just shows how angry and depressed you really are inside. I am convinced you&#39;re just some angry European who&#39;s pissed that the UK wants to quit your evil little club.
Comment 353.4	@Anonymous PS: Only fascist trolls like you think they have a right to speak in the name of the country(?) or for the name of Remainers. What a pathetic shit you really are! 😂
Comment354	No way should Corbyn give him an election before a people&#39;s vote on brexit. Whatever Boris wants to do, do the opposite, at least for now.
Comment 354.1	Why are you so scared of a general election before your &quot;people&#39;s vote&quot;?&quot;<br /><br />If the whole country wants another referendum then everyone will vote in Labour or Lib Dems yes?
Comment 354.2	You had a peoples vote in 2016.
Comment 354.3	Stephanie Tihanyi he wants to leave the EU, do you want to do the opposite, do you want to ignore the voices of 17 million British people who went and voted for leave?
Comment355	Blackmail will never work. A disgraceful man, to his office and this country.
Comment 355.1	but you are ok with remain doing everything they can to stop brexit?<br />your a bit of a hypocrite
Comment356	The people of the United Kingdom will give strong support to Boris in the general elections and the new Parliament will approve the Brexit deal 🙏
Comment 356.1	@Agent Smith Northern Ireland voted to stay in the E U
Comment 356.2	@Bilal Tuğrul Uğurlu May did, but Boris didn&#39;t do his best at all.  What he did was refuse to negotiate and then at the last minute he caved and sold out Northern Ireland.
Comment 356.3	@Agent Smith Theresa May and Boris Johnson did their best to reach an agreement with the European Union 🧐 Nobody can make a better deal than that.
Comment 356.4	They won&#39;t because the deal is shite.  That&#39;s why he tried to sneak it through in 2 days without giving anyone the chance to look at it.  For one, it creates a border INSIDE the UK.  The reason Ireland agreed to that is because it makes it likely that Northern Ireland will break away from the UK as they&#39;ll have a customs border with us anyway.
Comment 356.5	@Stephanie Tihanyi People see Boris struggling for Brexit and will support him in election 👊<br />Communist Jeremy Corbyn is the enemy of the UK state and people 😡
Comment357	Awfully sad to see the way the UK has gone with this clown in charge. Farage will be next. Bye bye UK, hello little england
Comment 357.1	@Mr Wolfe put your tinfoil hat on and go back to bed.
Comment 357.2	@Mr Wolfe if England is so amazing then why are you leaving the EU?
Comment 357.3	Mr Wolfe dry your eyes
Comment 357.4	Oh yeah, little England... Which has consistently been a competitive superpower every day for 200 years. Which came third in the olympic games. Which has nuclear weapons and power and worldwide trade, science and technology.<br /> Shut up dickhead.

Comment 359.2	@John farrell I&#39;ll look past the fact that you type like a literal four year old and say that not &#39;millions more&#39; want a no-deal. People like you see the EU as some kind of evil dictators when actually they fund infrastructure and distribute money for things like scientific research and helping the poorest in our society - so if that&#39;s your definition of a slave...

Comment 365.3	@Will Malin Technically no as a legend is more based on myth or folklore. But if he influences the fashion of Brexit or brings down the government, he will become a modern day Guy Fawkes.

Comment 367.3	@nature giver funny because the UK voted for the Brexit party in the EU election this year. Seems like plenty of people still want it.
Comment 367.4	@nature giver The polls were wrong then, they&#39;re likely wrong now
Comment 367.5	It won&#39;t happen. EU voted to extend it by next year. Plus most British oppose it well after the 2016 vote.
