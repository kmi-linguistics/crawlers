Comment6	The world potilicains are watching only. Save Iraqi people.
Comment7	Here&#39;s the situation, there is government (who robs people and can&#39;t do shit about anything) and there are militias (they rob the government and the people, they run the whole situation in Iraq in the sake of Iran, some of them are in the government but most of them are international criminals who run the government and do whatever Iran pleases) and finally there are the people who just want to live like humans and not being controlled by some militias who take orders from another country, these people chose not to be a part of the government or militias because they want to live freely, they just want their rights which became more like dreams for them, when they protest peacefully militias order to kill them (imagine holding your country&#39;s flag trying to claim your rights and you get shot by a sniper on a building) militias do their dirty work and blame USA for everything, I don&#39;t know if they&#39;re fooling the people or themselves at this point because we people are tired of this nonsense bullshit and we won&#39;t stop until we get what we deserve.
