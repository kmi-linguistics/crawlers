Comment23	Islam, always blame US for thier stupid war among them. What a joke of Muslims world
Comment24	BBC All they want is war, &amp; profits, Even here in the US we can see that the best case scenario is it all falls back under Assad, At least then people can go back to their lives &amp; back to work.  This Is a good thing, Yes the US helped the Kurds fight isis Being that we had a common enemy but that does not mean we were complete partners to defend them in their goal in a autonomous nation, Asad is no threat to us here in the US, he is stability And pretty much everyone in Syria is come to Wanting exactly that, So who are we to try to prevent that! Isis is done now it’s time to give it all back To the Syrian government
Comment25	Despite Turkey is a NATO member,  the western countries are trying to weaken to Turkey by using  the Kurdish separatists.  The Kurds have been attacking the Turks by using Syrian and Iraqi lands for years. They will no longer be able to do this shit because there will be 4 million Sunni Arabs between  Kurds and Turks. This was a plan of the Turkish deep state and they did it.. if  Kurds dare to attack  Turks as they used to,  Turks would strike  them back by using  Arabs. Sunni Arabs hate Kurds for their betrayal during the Iraq war. Millions of Arabs will learn Turkish and Turkish state will train these people and use them (already using tens of thousands as army backed and intelligence staff) in the army and intelligence or all over the middle east. Also these people will continue to be a joker against  european union that supports  pkk.  Turks accepted these refugees intentionally. This was the plan of  Turks from the beginning.  Stupid kurds  chose to get puppets of western countries  Instead of living in peace with the Turks.. The cards were shuffled again In the Middle East. The game is just beginning.

Comment 31.4	@raymond sutton well in any case not in America but in the USA, hopefully it won&#39;t get  into Mexico. It will be brutal, good luck.
Comment 31.5	not today all mainstream media thinks that we are stupid and granted there are stupid people that listen and believe this crap and that is why we in America are heading to civil war. People need to wake up
Comment32	BBC Propaganda!
Comment33	this was foreseen....Syria and the Kurds are natural allies against the Turks, unless we intend to stay there forever leave them to it
Comment34	It always seem like all roads lead back to Putin and Russia. Seems like everything President Trump does and says always leads back to Russia somehow. I swear hes Putin&#39;s man, doing whatever helps Russia and Putin out, hes gotta pay them back for winning the election for him. Wake up people, Republican or Democrat you need to see President Trump doesn&#39;t have the United States best interest in mind, he has HIS OWN best interest in mind. There&#39;s dumb people on both sides of the aisle, we need to put the differences aside and get President Trump out of office and get someone in there that is going to really help out the United States, not just their self... The American people come first, its sad that some would rather work with Russia then the Democratic Party
Comment35	Lets not forget that President Trump did not pull out all the troops! He left anywhere from 150-350 Soliders who are staying to &quot;Guard&quot; the Syrian Oil Fields... we can&#39;t protect the Innocent Civilians that are being killed for no reason, but we can protect the oil fields to make sure the enemy doesn&#39;t get a hold of them. I guess you can&#39;t make money off innocent civilans so President Trump didn&#39;t care about them, he only cared about  the oil field that he can make money off of.

Comment45	Gee Turkey is part of the European Union.  I&#39;m pretty sure this is a European problem.  We&#39;ve shoved the better part of a trillion dollars into European packets a year via NATO.  Maybe they can stop polishing their brass for a minute and take care of business.

Comment50	don&#39;t ever trust the policy of the US government it&#39;s a double standard and you&#39;ll be on the losing end.
Comment51	International reaction probably 1st chain edorgan wanted... What we need is don&#39;t give that in the way he expected... The real problem isn&#39;t with kurdish or syria... But edorgan party necessary in turkey internal politics.. An classic dictatorial measure, to use military campaign to solve poor internal popularity.. Especially for region under islam conservative influence, with delusion of empire superiority... <br /><br />N in edorgan case, where most turkish influenced by im, sence of military n international politics ascendancy should fulfil the delusion from their ppl main ideology... The dominant power to lead over other islamic region... Rising delusional trend of rising caliphate empire is practice way for edorgan, to leverage his popularity among his ppl...<br /><br />While their army mess around, we can lure political field under our own issue to break the source of their motive... Make enemy stage as their graveyard... 💀

Comment83	So we can to say that we are in front of duplicate scenario of Afrin (a Kurdish area occupied by turkish and the islamist groups). But this time in eastern board of Euphrate river, which is American influence area.<br />But some questions in zoom out:<br /><br />1- Isn&#39;t this new invasion in northern Syria by turkish army and islamist militias, gonna create withdrawal movement of Kurdish forces whose guard Abo Hol camp where (72000) ISIS fighter are arrested. an opportunity to escape!<br /><br />2- Did Assad regime (and behind him Iran specially and Russia less), will accept return of millions of Sunnites, inside the country, where they mostly are enemy ?<br /><br />3- Did Kurds will accept the abandon of them homes, fields, villages and cities for the sunnites arabian led-backed by turkey, and then  they become refugees inside the country ? Or they will resist and fight for them rights ?<br /><br />4- Isn&#39;t this new colonization of sunnites arab in northern Syria, meaning they are accepting the displacement and demographic changes which happened in them lands (Damasce, Daraa, Homs, Hama and Aleppo), by Assad regime (and Iran behind him), as a compensation, for an eternal NO return ?<br /><br />5- Isn&#39;t it true, that turkey, moving throw the army while its eyes on Misaki Millî ?

Comment84	turkey invasion = Recycling ISIS ...
Comment85	Pulling out of Syria was an extremely shrewd move. The partisan rhetoric opposing the pull out is the shrieking cry of an out of control military-industrial complex being suffocated by an upright Commander in Chief. Take the troops out of harms way. Send in the diplomats, and turn on the sanctions.
Comment86	Turkey has rights to secure its border! European who are blaming Turkey must return thier citizens. Turkey should kick them out toward Europe and stop fighting in Syria.
Comment87	What a faulty report!<br />If you interview a Syrian  Kurd,  Armenian-Christian, Orthodox Christian, or an Alawite they will welcome Assad troops because they saved them from ISIS before.<br /><br />On the other hand, if you interview a Syrian Arab-Sunni who fought against Assad or might even have helped ISIS or other Islamic radical groups he will voice his displeasure about Kurds and Syrian Government working together.<br /><br />If you would tell the audience who is cheering and who is not it would make it a lot easier to gain some perspective out of this report.
Comment88	Turkey is crazy if it thinks the world&#39;s powers are blind.<br />It will never belong to the EU and it is merit.<br />For Europe, the Kurds are more acceptable.<br />They are good fighters and opposed ISIS.<br />They&#39;re more simpatical to me.<br />Erdogan is crazy and the Turks follow him on tiptoe for fear.<br />Have no opinion?<br />He loses his pride.<br />And they dare to attack weaker and less armed militias with our weapons.<br />Turkey is a banner and turns for a while behind Russia and then for the USA.<br />I will be glad and look forward to coming from Europe and the US soon sanctions.<br />Turkey will go down economically.
Comment89	Should America be the world&#39;s cop? <br /><br />President Donald Trump has replaced American exceptionalism with “America First.” Now the United States is not distinct from other countries. We are a nation like any other, says Trump, and “it is the right of all nations to put their own interests first.” In his 2016 foreign policy address, Trump called it “a dangerous idea” to believe “that we could make western democracies out of countries that had no experience or interests in becoming a western democracy.”<br /><br />Why, then, is Washington spending $717 billion in fiscal year 2019 to maintain vast armies, fleets, and air armadas around the world? Not for defense, of America, anyway. It is to protect allies, assert influence, remake failed societies, dictate behavior, promote values, and more. All of these may have some value, though rarely as much as asserted. And none have much to do with protecting America’s territory, people, constitutional system, and prosperity.
Comment90	What a shameless nation kurds are,a day before they were inveigle USA and were ready to play as key puppet of Trump but when USA kick them<br />They are now praising asad army.<br />Hahaha...A gutless nation.<br />And its ridiculous that Donald trump fortified this kurds to eradicate Asad nation....<br />Now putin is the plan maker.🤣
Comment91	Turkey is no1 player for being endless war in Syria. Now pesmarga, pkk SAA and Hezbollah with underground support from Iran will make heavy prise to pay for Turkey for sure.

Comment106	Fake and very one sided, Turkey is fighting the YPG/PKK terrorists not the Kurds. There are 3 million plus kurds in Turkey alone. If there were animosity between them then there would have been big bloodshed in Turkey alone. So get the facts right Turkey is fighting terrorists which were labeled so by international communitys, agencys etc.

Love from an american citizen thinking of you and your safety and rescue from such a trajic ungodly situation. Love your neighbor as yourself. Who is my neighbor? All of man kind domestic and abroad. You are not forgotten.
Comment116	I am Juliet Tun.  I think maybe I was Vesta in a past life.  I am not a real Goddess.   I think Russia should stop bombing buildings.  Arabs die when Russia bombs. I think Syria soldiers and Russian soldiers should go in the streets and fight a Kurd soldiers.
Comment117	That was the purpose guys.   The Syrian army to get to control the north so the Kurds to come in their hands.   Hahhaa smart move guys. And the most important is: USA is out !  The most big achievement
Comment118	war has been proceeding by how has law and religion or prospective.
Comment119	🤥🤥🤥🤥🤥🤣🤣🤣🤣 BBC?
Comment120	I can’t believe turkey says Kurds free the ISIS members so they ( ISIS members ) can  join Turkish mercenaries to fight the Kurds again , its Turkey who want those prisoners freed to join his invasion army, and why would the Kurds has to give a damn to those Isis members apart from killing them and not letting them free after the whole world abandon them after defeating ISIS and left them to be massacred by Turkish army and their Islamist jihadies

Comment122	Hypocrite BBC, supporting terrorist Erdogan who openly supports ISIS... Thousands of ISIS terrorists are in Turkish army doing genocides of Kurds...
Comment123	"Assad/Syria is going down. Damascus will be a heap of ruins as well as all of Syria. Syria will be depopulated and destroyed. The Islamic militias will not lay down their arms and go home. Lebanon will be next, then Jordan which is hated because of it&#39;s secular government,(not sharia law) and it&#39;s relations with Israel. Speaking of, Israel will be next after being compelled to cede the <br />West <a href=""http://bank.in/"">Bank.in</a> exchange for peace with the U.S. leading the charge in this effort &quot;thinning Yacob (Jacob) at the waist&quot;. Land for peace treaties don&#39;t work, just ask Neville Chamberlain.. The Moslems cannot be trusted as the koran teaches that treaties with the infidels are not binding on Moslems. Israel will not be defensible as it will be only 5-6 miles across once the West Bank has been ceded. Tens of million of moslems will attack from the east, west, north and south. Israel will initially pile up the terrorist invaders while being condemned by the rest of the world as &quot;warmongers&quot; but Israel won&#39;t have enough bullets. Can anybody say&quot;Magog&quot;? Yahoweh will step in and destroy the invaders before Israel is all but completely destroyed. Islam will be no more. However, this war is but a prelude to the &quot;approaching storm&quot;, world war 3. By the mid to late summer of 2027, half the worlds population will be dead with the other half dying at various rates of acceleration. I know everyone will think I&#39;m crazy yet all of the events were penned 2550 years ago by prophets who have been one hundred percent accurate one hundred percent of the time as their source is unconstrained by time."

Comment144	Asad regime used chemical weapons, reported by British Broadcasting corporation in around 2011-12, after that, the international community started bombing Syria, millions perished, millions displaced. <br /><br />Now the same international community is calling Asad regime backed up by Russia - Syrian army!    Isis once destroyed according to United States intelligence, has now appeared back in the scene!   <br /><br />Do much propaganda BBC and Co.??
Comment145	hahaha, YOU hate this, but I love it.... This is what your lies get you, BBC..... Now EAT IT.
Comment146	<b>If Syria is a &quot;regime&quot; then why can&#39;t the BBC be honest and describe the monarchic, medieval, gulf theocracies, as theocratic, absolutist regimes?</b> &quot;Syrian Arab Army&quot; is the title of Syria&#39;s armed forces. Syrians are fighting to prevent their country being overrun by Turkish/Saudi/US/UK backed terrorists, or to prevent the country&#39;s disintegration. They did not join to be Assad&#39;s paramilitaries, they are the Army of Syria. Another regular omission, is the fact that <b>the Syrian Army have done the heavy lifting in defeating ISIS/Daesh.</b> The kurds fought ISIS/Daesh in the north of the country, but it was US air power that &quot;liberated&quot; Kobani and Raqqa, by levelling both cities. The kurds have since occupied everything east of the Euphrates, in the hope of creating a marxist utopian state, on Arab lands, funded by stolen oil. No discussion is permitted by the state broadcaster, about Syria&#39;s territorial integrity, after all it&#39;s an ancient country, why should it be broken up to create yet another US client state? <br /><br /><br />The BBC were also loathed to show that Assad still has support among Arabs, in fictional &quot;Rojava&quot;, but they didn&#39;t really go into depth as to the reasons why <b>Arabs resent the kurdish occupation.</b> Much more focus was given to the family in Turkey, which claimed that even though Erdogan is invading Syria, it&#39;s Assad who is keeping them from going home? They were &quot;happy&quot; when the Turkish army invaded, and they hoped to go home &quot;when the kurds left&quot; - so they expected that the Turks would take over all of northern Syria? They wouldn&#39;t even live in kurdish controlled areas, otherwise they would have already returned to Syria. This is contradictory. The BBC support the kurds, but they are so keen to highlight Assad&#39;s villainy, that they interview a family who want to return to Syrian lands, which Turkey have ethnically cleansed (and plan to annex)? Every report by the BBC on Syria, also assumes that the US redeployment, is a &quot;win&quot; for Russia and Iran?. What is more apparent is the <b>tense standoff that will ensue between Syrian forces, and Turkey, which as Jeremy admitted, would draw NATO/Russia into a hot war</b> - so how is that a &quot;win&quot; for Russia?

Comment148	Everyone in the west has listened to the war mongering lunatics, reporters and armchair tubers comments before and the problems in the middle east are still there, Trump has done the right thing, these people won&#39;t live together in peace, someone has to lay down their arms and make peace, no-one can force these people to live together.

Comment151	This is sort of logical solution, I still have no idea who and how many foreign troops is in Syria. The way the great powers, Russia and USA just set up shop in someone else backyard is concerning to the international order. Poor small nations like Syria, Libya, Yemen and countless nations  are proxy battleground for other militarise nation is dehumanising.

Comment182	Turkey going in to Syria is a direct result of PKK doing terror attacks in Turkey, and then escaping into Syria. And a top of that, they try to carve out their own country in the midst of syrian civil war, while everybody escaped. The nervs on those kurds..., and now they are &quot;surprised&quot; that Turkey comes after them, to stop the creation of a hostile terrorist country, and to place the syrian refugees where they really come from.  If you dont believe me, check amnesty international and their reports on the kurdish hostilities against syrian arabs, and christian minorities during the civil war in north syria.
Comment183	Erdogan and Putin are both intelligent, experienced leaders, these guys can easily outwit a draft-dodging boob like Trump, I&#39;m not even convinced Trump can read.
Comment184	Erdogan has nicely milked USA and European countries and now he is showing real face.
Comment 184.1	Er-Dog-Anne is a pile of dog waste.
Comment185	Erdogan, if you want to build a safe zone, do it to your side of the borders. This is an invasion! Period!
Comment 185.1	He doesn’t care about them because he has never read about 4 millions refugees in Turkey. He only reads from one source. He has a limited perspective and vision. He has just prejustices about other nations. He refuses to meet them.<br /><br />Or he is just a fraudster who makes publicity for teror organisations.
Comment 185.2	Kan, don&#39;t you know that the mentioned &quot;safe zone&quot; in Syria is needed for 3.6 million Syrian refugees who still live in Turkey or do you mean they should stay in Turkey forever?
Comment186	"lmao that dude at <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2d2uCCVF0A&amp;t=5m01s"">5:01</a> is the reporter that got high on air:<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLYVTdiACRA"">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLYVTdiACRA</a>"
Comment187	Turkey is on its own in this slaughter of innocents! They will pay dearly for murdering so many good people! It is inevitable that they will now face Syria, Iran and Russia! Unless Erdogan backs down there will be an escalation of these events ultimately leading large scale Turkish casualties! This is truly a major war zone that could spark WW3!

Comment197	Nothing new to see..Muslims just being Muslims.
Comment198	Why pretend to care about two children when hundreds are dying ?
Comment 198.1	Ike Turner you really seem to be reading between the lines here my point seems lost now but I couldn’t imagine having lost a child but to only see news about apparent British citizens, again it doesn’t matter if I care or not and that’s doesn’t mean I don’t care like you suggested I mean it doesn’t mater in the slightest the people who can make a difference don’t care
Comment 198.2	@A c All lives matter, but Great Britains job is to care for it´s citizens, and those kids have done nothing wrong, it is their British father or parents that have been wrong. Every country, and it´s embassies have a responsability for its own citizens, that´s how it works, whether you give a shit or not!!!
Comment 198.3	Ike Turner why do you think that ? I don’t think it matters if I care the people that matter don’t give a shit and you seemed to miss the point that this isn’t special in war zones but it does seem wrong to highlight two deaths in the area what about the other kids that died that day in the same area ?
Comment 198.4	It is a good thing to care about those kids!!! They should be brought to Britain !!! It is up to Britain to care for kids who have or have had british parents!!! Haven´t you got any concern for these poor kids?
Comment199	I think President Assad should be impeach.  I think he should be impeach because he has be President for more than 10 years.  He is a dictator.
Comment200	Nations like you doesn&#39;t care that hundreds of people dying in Yemen by the bombs made and sold by your country but you would have an issue with the nation trying to build up a safe zone. If the bomb that Turks are using made by your country things would of been different.

Comment 202.1	Assad predicted that the USA will abandon the Kurds.  Kurds should have listened to him and allied with him from the start
Comment203	FUCK Turkish invaion and fuck the insane Erdogan! Turkey needs to consider a new and saine president! He will otherwise bring Turkey down and to a disaster. He is totally fucked upp!
Comment204	They are terrorists not &quot;kurdish fighters&quot;. They killed more than 30.000 citizens of ours.  Hey, Brits and PKK/YPG lovers, we will not let you establish a Kurdish state.  If you really love them that much why do not you give them a part from your land. By the way, you should first solve the problem in Northern Ireland, I think.
Comment205	Why don&#39;t you call them a terrorist Kurdish fighter as your government US and UN have recognised that they are a terrorist organisation.<br />But you come up to say Kurdish fighters. Don&#39;t you think public should know what kind of fighters they are? How much your Zionist owners paying you? What ever the game you putting on is not working. Real man and real woman of this world has better awareness than ever before. People like you very noticeable like a cat piss in snow.
Comment206	Thank you.
Comment207	Turkey will clean the part of the north syria and give it back to its owner ( assad ). Result : Turkey happy and Syrian goverment happy
Comment208	PYD-  YPG are terrorist organisations they even killed one year old baby in Turkey and many other people, Turkey suffered enough from them. You keep saying them Kurds to manipulate the world to make the wirld think that Turkey slaughtering civilians. But everyone knows Turkey is the most hospitable country in the world hosting totally around 7 million people from Syria and other countries in its land without looking what their race. But no other western take any responsibility but manipulate.
Comment 208.1	@Accountability it&#39;s because these organisations doesn&#39;t hurt other countries and they have deal with &quot;other countries&quot;. But these are terrorists one they they hurt them as well.
Comment209	Tulsi knows what to do over there, she actually served; not a stupid puppet. She would never allow this reckless amateur decision making. Shut up and listen to a real leader!  Go Tulsi 2020!

Comment222	The hypocrite of the west absolutely staggering US to sanction Turkey over its fight with PKK after few days .  But nearly 5 years of Saudi and Emirati slaughter and starvation of Yemeni civilians is totally cool. Western world even provides the weapons!
Comment223	Trump is either ignorant or corrupt, or both. How can the President leave Syria with Iran and Russia fighting Turkey, who the hell is worse, ANSWER, AMERICA IS. !!!!!!
Comment224	Just wanted to state the obvious here - The US by aligning with the YPG/PKK have essentially become a state sponsor of terrorism against Turkey a member of NATO. The US has opened up a dangerous Pandora&#39;s box. I think the US &amp; EU need to take a good look at themselves before they start arguing about who&#39;s the good terrorist and who&#39;s the bad terrorist - They have de-facto become terrorist sympathisers - There is no distinction, the simple fact is that you cannot fight terrorism with terrorism.
Comment225	Only Turkey powerful than all middle east
Comment226	Trump is a coward
Comment227	He &quot;wants&quot; to study medicine in UK... Odd, since there are better medical schools in Turkey producing better doctors. Just ask many Brits and EU citizens coming to Turkey for medical operations that were not trusted or could not to be done UK/EU. ALSO, you can do all your propaganda. It does not matter. Turkey will free its borders from terrorists and there is NOTHING you can do about it. Thanks for trying, thus, revealing your &quot;impulse response&quot;...

Most damaged countries Turkey and Lebanese after than Syria. Let&#39;s talk about reality, Turkey have to some safe territory for nobody come again.  oil can&#39;t afford to 4 billion person&#39;s food. Reality not about the dirt and oil.
Comment 230.2	@ahmet faruk ulusoy civilians lost... You really think the goverment gives a shit? Its another political card to be played for the public manipulation... Get real bro
Comment 230.3	@Alexandros Markhs bro I&#39;m talking about civilian lost. There is anything about politics benefits.
Comment 230.4	Turkey needs to become bigger... And that means Syria, Iraq, Cyprus and the islands of Greece must become smaller. Also kill the Kurds so they dont grow larger and want a state. That would be a giant threat to Turkey and it would crush this dream. Also Turkey needs oil. And lots of it. So the next step is to secure all the rich oil regions like the Meditterenian and the Iraqean Kurds.

Comment 260.4	@Edin Watson hmm that is the theory but i wouldn&#39;t say Saddam was all rhetoric ,he invaded kuwait and was in a heavy war with iran .<br />There is no doubt invading iraq was a huge mistake  but this idea that they took the oil ,did they ????? I dont know if the uk or usa ended up taking any oil .it doesn&#39;t matter though as many died for nothing.
Comment 260.5	@Mark Smith Saddam was all rhetoric. WMD was fake and an excuse to take Iraq&#39;s oil by force. All for the sake of some oil. The whole region is in conflict now thanks to bush and blair. Civilians are slaughtered, displaced and can&#39;t even rebuild their life for the future.

Comment281	so when Turkey invades another country it&#39;s civil war, not an invasion..... right 🤔
Comment282	They are milita they have no chance against Professional Turkish army
Comment 282.1	@rem kap And the Syrians aren&#39;t protecting their country? You&#39;re saying they will abandon their country and run away? The 10% is a temporary gain taken by surprise invasion. Last I heard they&#39;re fighting back. Not running away. They&#39;re being supported by many countries  which will make that a Turkish Vietnam. It&#39;s a quagmire if you ask me.
Comment 282.2	@Futt Bucker  Main difference afghans and vietnamese were protecting their country because of that they could defeat their superior enemies. <br />SDF = YPG = PKK is terrorist organization so they do not have this type motivation. As a result of that they prefer to escape than fighting. So as you may see they have lost already 10% of planned safezone in only 7 days.
Comment 282.3	@Vüsal Ağayev And Russian didn&#39;t know their borders?
Comment 282.4	@Futt Bucker afghanistan and vietnam isnt syria Turkey knows its border
Comment 282.5	@Futt Bucker Well technically the US won every major engagement with the Vietnamese, they only &quot;lost&quot; due to a poor hearts and mind strategy.

Comment 297.2	Bombing the shit out of suicide bombers who target mostly metropols and civilians counts as a war crime now? Back up your NATO ally you piece of shits before they join Russia and China.
Comment 297.3	Who will pay for what we lost in 40 years? We are not fighting in Syria. We provide border security. We buy bombs every day. But you don&#39;t know because we don&#39;t cry like ypg.

Comment307	Lol... Let Turkey attack Russian troops and watch how they run back to NATO and beg for forgiveness!
Comment 307.1	@Александр Кононов Spasiba for the information highly appreciate it Komarade.
Comment 307.2	@Anatoly Somali Abbi Turkey is our neighbor with whom we have normal trade relations. Russia will not go to war with Turkey because of the Kurds. Putin is simply using this situation for his own purposes, and most likely he has already agreed with Erdogan.
Comment 307.3	Erdogan is an ally of Russia...I think that much is obvious now..

Comment314	Why don&#39;t you just stop that? You are not the only news source any more. People all know what&#39;s going on! US wants oil, Russia wants a way to Mediterranean sea... And west wants a weak Turkish Republic. More than half of Turkish people, and so many people all around the world, love President Erdoğan, he is the last-only leader telling the TRUTHS without fear. But you (west) have always tried to stop him since 2013, fortunately you are being unsuccessful. Please stop! I love my leader, I love my country and I have three daughters. We just want to have a living, which I make it teaching YOUR LANGUAGE. Please leave us alone, let us do what is to be done. Or you know; 4m refugees want to live in &quot;wealth and super democracy&quot; in your country.
Comment315	1 ambitious country who wants to be superior.. who wants power.. who wants to destroy its enemies 1 by 1 whatever it takes.. forming and funding people to destroy their own country.. to against to their leaders..

Comment316	Very nice
Comment317	Is this BBC or al-jazeera? Whose side you on BBC?
Comment 317.1	Why is it about sides all the time?, they are neutral, if you want biased news, look elsewhere.
Comment318	Britain France USA and Israel must pay 1 Trillion dollars reparations to Syria for sponsoring ISIS Nusra Alqaeda HTS and other 50 savage Wahhabi groups in Syria and destroying their beautiful country. US UK have blood on their hands for 500000 gang raped and slaughtered and decapitated and beheaded and in many cases their organs stolen while they were alive. You will face god&#39;s wrath for what you did to Syria.. The Mainstream media journalists who participated in the demonisation of Assad and promoted this proxy war will also pay a heavy price.
Comment319	Lets go Kurds , back off Turkey
Comment 319.1	You back off moron.
Comment320	Turkey is fallen into trap by us &amp; russia
Comment 320.1	Bro Turkey is the rogue state which supports terrorists.

Comment 320.3	Nope. It&#39;s just goes as planned. YPG will be disarmed by Syrian Army and retreat from North Syria. Second stage: North Syria will be rebuild for Syrian refugees. Turkey is getting rid off YPG and Russia will give North Syria back to Assad.
Comment321	And let the European fighters free and go home to Europe. So that we can have a nice guarilla terror war in Europe. Yes wir shaffen das!
Comment322	Fuck you Trump! Now we lost the kurds to assad-.-
Comment323	Trump got fucked up. Now no role in Syria. Russia taken it&#39;s position
Comment324	Love💓💓 Turkey Form india InshaAllah we spread Islam in World
Comment 324.1	really ur not indian. may be some pakistani or any other bot - faking as indian muslim
Comment 324.2	Spread you legs,its better
Comment 324.3	İts not operation to spread İslam to world. İts operation for project millions müslim from them. See nextTurkey will build this location for syrians.
Comment325	Trump betrayed our friends the Kurds. Obama should have never got us involved in the civil war to begin with, but once we were there, we should have stayed and helped the Kurds form their own country. They fought alongside us against Isis, and they were the ones that did most of the fighting, all we did was give them air support. This is not the way to treat friends that fight with and for you. Trump should not have had the power to withdraw our forces without Congressional approval. Our congress would not have abandoned the Kurds like this, and both parties are pissed at Trump for allowing Erdogan to invade like this.
Comment 325.1	If you are wondering why Congress can&#39;t do anything, well you see Obama did a grab for more presidential powers during his two terms and so also got some powers that allowed him to do this without congress. you can thank Barrack  Obama.<br /><br /><br />Anyway The US if it had to could take out Turkey, Turkey ain&#39;t powerful enough to fight the concentrated might of the USA, but here is the thing as people have said before the US population don&#39;t want another middle eastern conflict, Turkey is used as a buffer to stop Russian advancement into the Mediterranean, The USA would also need to kick Turkey from NATO first and remove the nuclear weapons located there as well.
Comment 325.2	Dont be sorry for ypg, you have betrayed nobody. Actually ypg used america. They have gained billions worth of Guns from Us. They took control of a large piece of land and they did ethnic and politicial cleansing. They chased arabs and non ypg kurds out of region. Dont be fooled by their liberal appeareance. Orginally they are controlled by stalinist pkk headquarters.
Comment 325.3	@handsoffmygun MF But he was going to. I don&#39;t think you know anything about Erdogan. That is exactly the kind of thing he&#39;d do. He&#39;s not all talk. Erdogan is the real deal hardliner bad guy. He&#39;d just pass right through US forces. Turkey invaded not with Turkish Army, but with Al Qaeda and former ISIS members with Turkish Army following in and providing supporting fire. The only reason they didn&#39;t invade earlier was that he needed to build this army first. Their proxy forces would have killed US troops no problem and Erdogan would have claimed innocence. Wasn&#39;t his troops, and he&#39;d just say it was probably the Kurds or it was an accident. US troops shouldn&#39;t have been standing next to Kurds if they didn&#39;t want to catch stray fire. It&#39;s the same way he&#39;s going to try to get away with genocide. Wasn&#39;t my troops, it was the &#39;Syrian National Army&#39; and it&#39;s not my fault they kept advancing right past that 30km buffer zone. They&#39;re not my troops. They&#39;re Syrians fighting in Syria. His orders to his troops were to not fire on US troops and not commit genocide so he did his part.<br /><br />Regardless, US couldn&#39;t do anything to stop Turkey without opening fire on Turkish forces or their proxy army, and the US wasn&#39;t going to do it. Erdogan knew that and had no reason not to just drive right through a tiny number of US troops like they weren&#39;t even there. He thought he was being generous by giving Trump a couple days warning to tell his troops to start running. Trump sure as hell didn&#39;t need to approve anything or he&#39;d have had his troops out BEFORE giving approval for that invasion.<br /><br />The US is in no position to go to war with Turkey even if it wanted to. We&#39;ve got a big airbase with a bunch of nukes sitting right in the middle of their country. We need an excuse to kick Turkey out of NATO and pull our troops and especially our nukes out of their country before they inevitably turn on us, wipe out the US troops and aircraft, and seize our nuclear weapons.
Comment 325.4	Winston Syme - As long as we had US soldiers there, Erdogan was not going to invade. I agree that we should have never been in Syria to begin with, but to abandon these Kurds like Trump did, is shameful. Secretary of Defense, General Mattis, thought the same thing and it was the reason he resigned. I think Trump later realized that he made a mistake by giving Erdogan the green light, and now he&#39;s attempting to rectify the situation with sanctions. We should have stayed and helped the Kurds form their own country before we left. We owed it to these people that helped us fight Isis. Now unfortunately they were forced to go back to Assad and live under his regime instead of having their own homeland and governing themselves. I do agree with what you said though, we should cut all ties with Turkey until they get rid of that dictator Erdogan.
Comment 325.5	Turkey was invading no matter what. US had the option of getting out of the way or going to war with Turkey. We&#39;re in no position to go to war with Turkey right now. We need to get Turkey out of NATO and our nukes out of their territory before it&#39;s even an option. And even then, that&#39;s going to be a massive war with a massive amount of casualties on both sides. Removing all ties and support from Turkey, weakening them by economic and diplomatic means, and basically telling everyone Turkey&#39;s on their own if anyone wants a piece of them, is our best course of action right now.
Comment326	And what of NATO Article 5?
Comment 326.1	@Winston Syme Ah, thanks for sharing. Makes sense that if the NATO country is the aggressor Art. 5 can&#39;t be invoked.
Comment 326.2	@Winston Syme A member country cannot be expelled unless they want to leave. Even in the time when Greek-Turkish agression both of the country&#39;s NATO memberships were not even at the stake. No one is going to do shit over couple of suicide bombing terrorists. And for your information PKK is supposed to be accepted as a terrorist organisation by the USA and most of the European countries. Get real.
Comment 326.3	Turkey is the clear aggressor in Syria and has been an aggressor for years. Thus the defensive pact can not be invoked. That said, Turkey needs to be removed from NATO ASAP.
Comment327	Well, Russia is gonna bomb Turkish army soon
Comment 327.1	Then turkey and our 80 million soldiers are ready believe me all turks born as a soldier
Comment 327.2	Guess Turkey should have listened to the US when they were told not to do it. US certainly isn&#39;t going to save them from Russia at this point.
Comment328	The only way to stop Turkey&#39;s invasion is war with Turkey. Nothing got green lit. Turkey basically said we&#39;re doing it and you can either get out of the way or fight us. The US opted to not go to war with Turkey. Sanctions, removal from NATO, etc, are the only other options. However, Britain or any other country are more than welcome to declare war on Turkey over this at any point.
Comment329	BBC - 100% FAKE NEWS!
Comment330	soon the syria war will spreading to other countries, and on and on.
Comment331	The Syrian armed forces officially took control of a number of settlements in the provinces of Raqqa, Hasaka and Aleppo. For many years, these territories were under the control of militants of various groups, and then fell under the rule of the Kurdish militia
Comment332	USA/UK disastrous legacy
Comment333	How happy is the one who says I am a TÜRK 🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷🇹🇷 long live RECEP TAYYİP ERDOGAN❤❤❤❤❤
Comment334	Everyone should respect ASSAD now ,everyone wanted him death assassinated media trying to brainwash us all in every country, they destroyed his country his people but he never gave up his brave soldiers and citizens loyal till the end u should not laugh at him he is probably the best war leader of all time so much respect for ASSAD now and look him now protecting the Kurdish people  you are a all a disgrace for making fun of him he is a true leader and righteous that&#39;s why putin support him every leader should learn from ASSAD his people love him his soldiers would die for him
Comment335	Good wiil punish you☝️
Comment336	Liar slander america😡
Comment337	Pyd (kurdish terrorists which guard usa oil fields)  release ısıs fighters from prison. This is proff of untrustworthy how they are. Usa and Europe wants terrorists in these areas not families. otherwise they would have already taken action.  We have 3.5 millions syrian guests. These syrian people in Turkey now and they have to turn back their lands. These areas not only kurdish areas turkomen arap and kurds lived there. Pyd-pkk invade all empty sections. And world keept quiet. Russia Usa killed dozens of people why everybody uncomfortable from Turkey? Because they share syrians people lands already.  You are illegal not Turkey !
Comment338	The Turks are just Ethnic Cleansing nationalities like they did with the Greeks, Armenian&#39;s, Assyrian&#39;s out of these areas. The west has seen this all before and it all started with the fall of Constantinople. It&#39;s the Kurds turn to be ethnically cleansed by the Turks. Nations should not blame the Turks this is what they have always done for a very long time.
Comment 338.1	The Russians, Americans set you up for the fall. Who is going to benefit from this? It&#39;s not going to be Turkey who wants to resurrect the Ottoman Empire. Syria is the proxy war that is going to lead into a massive world war. Whoever partakes in this world war will be destroyed. These are not my words but are the words of the Saints who say the same thing.
Comment 338.2	Alektoros you are crazy hope meet you on the battlefield.
Comment 338.3	Soon a 1/3 of Turks will be going back where you came from. 1/3 of Turks will die, and a 1/3 will convert to Orthodoxy. All this is all part of the plan to break up Turkey. All these nations fighting it out in Syria who do you think they are working for? It is for all of them to be destroyed. Soon the candles that are lit under the earth will be lit in Churches. Constantinople will be GREEK ORTHODOX AGAIN. These are not my words these are the words of the Saints.
Comment 338.4	Alektoros kurds are not native owner of these land kurds setteled anatolia 300 years after turks
Comment 338.5	Alektoros get mad at chinese they forced us to migrate to anatolia.Also turks were working in the byzantine army as mercenary if you have welcomed us we would be cristhian and part of the byzantine .Muslims have welcomed us even they have killed turks at talkan and curcan at ac. 700s so your attitude to migrant people is the part of problem.
Comment339	Well...<br />You can tell the kurds not to worry... Mr. Trump has your back 😜<br />(Sarcasm Off)
Comment340	Oh BBC, not it&#39;s government forces?!...What happened to the regime forces?
Comment 340.1	They exactly now what are they. You are on wrong place if you are looking Real news. There are 3.8 million syrian in Turkey and PYD PKK killed thousend of them. They even didint make it news.
Comment341	Nothing to worry with Washington&#39;s meddling genius, they&#39;ll come up with a quick solution like they always do and everyone will be holding hands by 6pm. It&#39;s why the world thinks the U.S. is a peacemaker. It&#39;s like mass production warfare. That last sentence is the only one that&#39;s not sarcastic.
Comment342	AL-BBC

They know(MSM) that once the Kurds merge with Syrian forces the only enemy left for them is Turkey and their radical Islamist militants. Im quite sure syrians prefer a secular regime rather than a Turkey backed Islamic State

Comment 362.2	Anonymous yes, go to google
Comment 362.3	Anonymous  The YPG and YPG are the military arm of the PKK. Which is a communist/terrorist faction of Kurdish people trying to create their own country in Syria (Rojava). They have been fighting Turkey since 1984 and are known in over 12 NATO countries as being a terrorist organization. Research the history of the PKK. They have killed many Turkish people. Yes they fought ISIS but only to take the North of Syria for themselves. They also killed many Arabs in Syria.
Comment363	You know, if you cared so much you could&#39;ve put your own troops on the border. Brits, French, German, then you could stay there forever and try to retain the peace in that mess.
Comment 363.1	hey as a Brit i think none of us should be there, it a the one region of the world where there is never any peace, why waste lives there.

Comment368	Media make naration with invasion and genoside.. The Turk in many occasion always explain the reasons they do this, they wanna make secure zone in they border and minimilize threat from militias (a group of Kurd, not Kurdish peoples) who heavily weaponise by US after war agains ISIL. The secure zone will be use not for the Turk peoples but for  Syrian refuges.
Comment369	Are you sure it’s USA fault?  If there are no police in my town, and I start bombing and killing, is it the Mayor’s fault?
Comment 369.1	HistoryFan476ad then take them in ur country cuz if u dont know turkey has 4million syrian people and tell me if we want to kill innocent people why we are taking them in our lands?
Comment 369.2	It is an act of self defense as most of the suicide bombers who target civilians in metropolian cities come from that shit hole. So yeah, we are going to flatten the shit out of that place and be a real NATO ally instead of blaming Turkey.
Comment 369.3	@Tom Branch Yeah but The USA is not the police man of Syria, Americans want there people home not to be used as human shields.
Comment 369.4	It is if the Mayor pulled the police out of the town and left it open to attack.
Comment370	Assads and Irans army are not real opposition to Turkey! Every body wants the Kurds dead as they are claiming land in many countries including Russia! Can&#39;t see Russia really helping Assad! iran also has problems with the Kurds!

Comment378	Support Kurds and Syrians against illegal turk invasion and aggression. NATO won’t go to war for turkey if turkey is the aggressor like in this situation. Syria, Kurds, and Russians would fuck turkey in the ass quick and throw turkey across northern Syria back to Turkroach land.
Comment379	A bunch of idiots talk about Syria. Your prime minister is a longtime fan and sponsor of ISIS and Jabhat al Nusra. Pathetic idiot. Your prime minister only said for several years: Assad must leave. First league idiot

Comment400	Turkey is out of control. They are still blood thirsty and anti Christian. They got away with the Armenian Genocide <br />, now they are doing the same with the Kurds. So much for democracy and human rights supported by the US!

Comment 402.2	What Turkish guy ?
Comment403	bbc you give them russian or chinese aks?
Comment 403.1	what about Chinese？
Comment404	You Brits have some audacity. What was the UK doing to help the Kurds, SDF, YPG, YPJ or Peshmerga in Iraq? Your Government treated those who where returning from fighting ISIS with the Kurds as Terrorist while letting ISIS fighters return to society!! HYPOCRITES!! YOU ARE A BUNCH OF COWARDICE FILLED VAGINAS!! What was the UK doing to fight ISIS when the UK had many ISIS inspired &amp; directed attacks on your home soil? You have absolutely no right or room to criticize the United States or President Trump when your Government has barely if at all assisted the Kurds or the fight against ISIS at all. Your cowardice is very obvious. GTFOH with your leftist biased reporting.
Comment405	SUPPORT TURKEY AGAINST TERRORISTS!!!!!
Comment406	This BBC is bullshit news .. The truth is it was the West that cause all this problems and then blame it on others
Comment407	How many lives were lost for nothing? Just because of the decision of 1 stupid man ; d trump and in this case , again &quot;d&quot; stands for dumb*ss.
Comment408	So, when Russia retakes a majority Russian part of their country after the US and Nato yet again meddled in foreign affairs,  that was worthy of extreme sanctions and diplomatic isolation. When Turkey (a US ally) invades another sovereign country, nobody cares... Typical hypocrisy...
Comment409	I would fight with the kurds... Fuck Turkey 🖕🖕🖕
Comment410	The Kurds were key to containing ISIS and this is how they get rewarded...simply disgusting, like the entire foreign policy of the US of the past 2 decades...and not just since Trump. It s also highly cynical to complain about Russia s presence in Ukraine whilst basically inviting Turkey to invade Syria...let alone that the US presence there was unlawful to begin with. But hey double standards are the one true constant when it comes to US foreign policy.
Comment 410.1	Noname Nameless we have been in that area for to long we did what we set out to do and it&#39;s time for our sons daughters fathers and mother&#39;s to come home.  And for a person who isn&#39;t even from this country to talk shit about shit they don&#39;t know shit about is a disgrace and you need to deal with your own country before you speak on mine
Comment 410.2	@Mark Smith Nobody cares homo.
Comment 410.3	@suyash sultaniya What shit country do you hail from?
Comment 410.4	Russia and the SAA were &quot;key&quot; to containing ISIS and US bombing in Raqqa. Just because the Kurds fought ISIS does NOT mean they get to have a country in Syria  called Rojava.
Comment411	Kept that picture for years have you? You must’ve washed and pressed it then since it looks brand new! Looks like arse-licking in action to me.....
Comment412	I’m glad Syria is helping fight the real terrorists
Comment 412.1	​@Süleyman Akhan well  ur still a terrorists since you backed and supported and funded the terrorists in syria for years<br />and now when they couldn&#39;t do their mission turkey publicly got involved <br />your country is the real terrorism supporter<br />the attack on kurds is helping ur jihadists and isis members to escape !
Comment 412.2	Süleyman Akhan <br /><br />Why do you all care so much about who the pedophile prophet Mohammed’s true heir is. Please kill each other off soon
Comment413	Proof Trump has an  IQ lower than my morning dump. But are we surprised he made this call to withdraw his troops?  Now look at the result
Comment 413.1	Why don&#39;t you grab a rifle and go guard the Kurds from the Turks then.
Comment 413.2	Hes been planning that for months now,we cant stay there for the Kurds forever,we arent even supposed to be in Syrian lands,we were there to help eliminate the Islamic caliphate and that&#39;s been done
Comment414	The propaganda machine is in full speed. SUPPORT TURKEY AGAINST TERRORISTS !!!!!!
Comment415	Ignorant people- the F16’s will obliterate Syrian forces in minutes
Comment 415.1	syria army protect by russia so turkey failed
Comment 415.2	those are u.s weapons, turkey should be kicked from nato
Comment 415.3	I don&#39;t think so. If they try, they may be in a VERY difficult situation and lose a lot of their army - which is good at bombing and shelling undefended people.
Comment416	I support the young turk..
Comment 416.1	@Mosh Dude 😁😁😁😁😁
Comment 416.2	@Adil Khan oh what&#39;s the point with arguing with Brainwashed jihadi. Good your Pakistan is best. Well done 👍
Comment 416.3	@Mosh Dude maybe but there is uncle Sam before him
Comment 416.4	@Adil Khan IDK what&#39;s RSS, but I know pakistan is safe heaven for terrorist since bin laden
Comment 416.5	@Mosh Dude r you fantastic hindu from RSS background???
Comment417	YPG dissolving itself and going under Syrian Armed Forces would be the solution: Heavy weapons would be under the control of a central government and the Syrian army is a conscript army; after the soldiers are done with their duty they would leave their weapons and go home. This would give Assad a complete victory which seems to be the sticking point: The plan of partitioning Syria would end with failure; blocking Iranian influence in the region would fail; the hope of one day kicking Russia out of Mediterranean  would end; delivering Kirkuk oil to Mediterranean through a client state carved out of Syria would not come true. Turkey&#39;s action seems to be  hastening this outcome and that seems to be reason for the cry in the media and not a real concern for Syrians&#39; well being.
Comment 417.1	But don&#39;t forget many Syrians fled for the Assad regime.
Comment 417.2	The western media don&#39;t give a sideways fuck about Syrians. They only care about kurds, and &quot;moderate rebels&quot;. Hundreds of thousands have been killed in government areas, by ISIS and other terrorist groups backed by the west. They show a boy covered in dust and claim he was a gas attack victim, but when that boy appears in the Hague to testify, even he gets called a &quot;Putin puppet&quot;. The US has lost the war, they have lost in Afghanistan, in Iraq (Al Sadr party now in power), in Lybia, and now Syria. What does it all mean? This is the zenith of US imperial might - they can no longer able to execute 20th century style regime change, e.g. when they installed Piochet, Suharto, or Shah Mohammed Reza. Those days are over... forever. Wherever the US meddles, it will find competitor states counter-meddling, and yet they claim that when this is done to them its a &quot;pearl harbour 9/11 attack on our democracy, blah, blah....&quot;?
Comment 417.3	@Infernal460 This is the same argument that created Israel. They are already a nation, but they can&#39;t be a state, because it would mean carving a country out of existing countries, which is what the US wants. They want to weaken Shia nations, and create another Israel client state, with US military bases stationed there forever. So what if they want a country - people can just have one because they feel like it?
Comment 417.4	@hasaan choudhry if democracy came to Syria there would be Sharia or the law made by Islamists in less than 1 year... And as a result democracy would last until the first elections... We should back fuckin Assad for not allowing the country to go full ISIS not fuckin blame him.
Comment 417.5	This all happened because assad was a dictator and was forced by the West to become democratic but assad did not want to end his rule and rebel groups formed to fight assad supported by the US and failed creating ISIS
Comment418	USA AND ALIES: Let the Kurds free IS fighters + Let them regain strength + Blame it on Turkey Iran and Russia + Create another excuse to invade Syria = Start WW3
Comment419	Don&#39;t know why Americans and Europeans always have a opinion about what&#39;s going on in Middle East and when Middle Easterns refugees go to America and Europe they all start yelling get them out of our countries.<br />We trying to stay out, just keep us alone.<br />We survived thousands of years before and we will survive after.
Comment 419.1	@Geen naam it&#39;s easy, keep your governments out of there.<br />Our problems, we can handle them.
Comment 419.2	@Geen naam I&#39;m pretty sure that you&#39;re not welcoming judging by your tone.<br /> Please don&#39;t assume all Europeans feel like you
Comment 419.3	I live in a European country and 1/16 of our people are muslim now. You cant say we arent welcoming, but yeah we also do like to maintain our own culture.
Comment420	I assume since ISIS is gone then you&#39;re supposed to leave but you&#39;re creating another ISIS for your brother turkey and you&#39;re accusing them of terrorism.
Comment421	Another Mohammad for Britain, This one wants to be an engineer.
Comment 421.1	@Franga# It&#39;s John from the Beatles. George and Ringo are begging for a US trial.
Comment 421.2	Your picture is terrifying
Comment422	Shame on the BBC reporter in Turkey. well done for being a part of Turkish invasion propaganda. She was reading Defince ministary anouncement . As a text payer, it is a waste of our money, she could have done in in office in London! Shame
Comment423	Trump should be ashamed. I knew withdrawal of US would start something.<br />Kurds could still face Genocide, Assad will have to pay them back for fighting with so-called Terrorists.<br />Trump hang your head in shame for putting the Kurds in such a vulnerable pisition<br />Erdoğan too, hang your head in shame.<br />You gained esteem by letting those many thousands displaced by the Monster Bashar Al Assad.<br />I know many Turks who gave aid to these camps by teaching the children, trying to open the Worlds eyes to the reality of what Bashar Al Assad was doing.<br />I cannot believe the majority of Turkish people agree with Erdoğans doing this.<br />So many Turks helped Syrian so-called terrorists flee.<br />Russia insisted the West could assist with ISIS only, when those who started with peaceful demonstrations began being shot by Snipers, attacked by their own Syrian Army, eventually they reluctantly took up arms. I knew many who did so, not just ordinary working Syrians, Professionals, Academics. If taken alive tortured to death, videos proudly taken by their own Syrian Brothers so proud to be getting Assads 40 pieces of Silver, even children not having become teens fell victim to their rage. Videos were shared, someone with a conscience shared to have them made public. They made horrendous viewing.<br />Assad in every interview denied every happening, targeting Hospitals, Chemical Bombs dropped on Civilian areas. He constantly said he never gave orders, never happened.<br />It did, his sadistic brother happily took on the role of subjugation any opposition as his Father had done for 40 years before Assad.<br />He took over Syria in a Coup having worked his way through the ranks. He did not come from a wealthy family. The billions hidden away around the World came from denying Syrians so much.<br />While Syrian Army slaughtered, his pampered British born wife, a Mother of 3, continued to purchase her Designer Clothes and Jewellery from top fashion houses using her friends to purchase as they would not sell to her.<br />In hacked emails she found this very amusing whilst ordering through one of this friend&#39;s necklaces, one with black diamonds etc.<br />Thrilled when she got them<br />Shame on you Erdoğan for letting down your own people many of whom helped those elderly men and women, Mothers and their Children.<br />May Allah bring shame on you.<br />May God bring shame on you.<br />Whichever God you believe in pray and ask them to make Erdoğan pay for this travesty and to Trump for causing this by withdrawing US troops.<br />Trump is going to cause a World War by his actions, yet he still cuddles up to Saudi Arabia who, I&#39;m think I&#39;m correct in saying, little is ever known what China does, has the highest rate of executions, torture to this Activists who have begged for change. MBS Crown Prince of Saudi has even incarcerated cousins, anyone who tries to reason. There&#39;s no reasoning with that Monster.<br />Incarcerating Imams, Academics, it doesn&#39;t matter who you are he will get you.<br />Some of his Family fled to reside one Europe etc, so far he has managed to capture them return them to Saudi. None have been seen again.<br />Erdoğans only saving grace for many was allowing the Syrian Camps on its borders.<br />Like Assad, you do not criticise him and get away with it. Families keep quiet for fear they and every relative they have will disappear too.<br />Erdoğan also has billions secreted around the World, where did that money come from?<br />He only spoke out about Adnan Khashoggi because he hates Saudi.<br />God help the Kurds left now to their fate with Assad and Erdoğan bombarding them too.<br />Erdoğan I&#39;m sure was thrilled when Trump made his announcement. He could get at the Kurds. He hates them too.<br />Russia didn&#39;t help either, telling the West they could only fight ISIS as US Senate refused Obama to allow troops to help so-called terrorists, Europe and any other Country had to stand back too.<br />When Assad had list 80% of Syria, Putin came to help him put the Syrians back in their box.<br />Yes, many many Syrians did end up in boxes, we call them coffins.
Comment424	Isint this why we have nukes?
Comment425	Kurds are extremely stupid! Turkey said only 30 km. they had a lot of more land. Now they have nothing and will be persecuted by Assad as he did before the revolution!
Comment 425.1	Why push an agreement with Assad and there is a lot of land left for the Kurds!!!

Comment429	It was all done after Trumps green light and now Trump will impose sanctions on Turkey?😆😆<br />At the end....Russia is winning in Middle East😏
Comment 429.1	@handsoffmygun MF Not most,come on Trump has massive support base.
Comment 429.2	Britain France USA and Israel must pay 1 Trillion dollars reparations to Syria for sponsoring ISIS Nusra Alqaeda HTS and other 50 savage Wahhabi groups in Syria and destroying their beautiful country. US UK have blood on their hands for 500000 gang raped and slaughtered and decapitated and beheaded and in many cases their organs stolen while they were alive. You will face god&#39;s wrath for what you did to Syria.. The journalist who participated in the demonisation of Assad and promoted this proxy war will also pay a heavy price.
Comment 429.3	Most Americans disagree with what Trump did, and also people in our government and military disagree with Trump&#39;s stupid decision. We should have left US forces there to protect the Kurds and help them form their own country. We owe it to these people, because they fought with us against Isis. What Trump did was a betrayal of our friends the Kurds.
Comment 429.4	There is no winning the Middle East
Comment 429.5	No they won’t. They did it because they all want assad regime to control syria

Comment 437.1	@Jan Verboven There was never an Greek state on Cyprus , Ottomans took it from the genevize.  before the ww1 ottomans rent it to the brits , yes it was rented.  during britain rule greeks rizen up  a few times. so the brits gave up. 3 countries were the guarantors they made a contitution. as majorty greeks had more rights then turks. But greeks didnt want turks to have even those little rights, they didnt want them there at all. 1960 they started etnic cleansing men women and children were slougtered. Turkey was going to interfere at 1964 , all the turkish troops were loaded to the ships and the ships left. Just then the johnson letter came so the ships returned. But the violance didnt stop greeks wanted the whole island. and wanted to unite it with greece, so finally Turkey with the right of bening guarantor interfered. İm  an atheist social democrat person. i dont like erdogan at all , ive never voted for and i never will. i just cant take the double standarts and hypocracy of the so called civlized west !
Comment 437.2	"@talat guneyli Cyprus was historically Greek, until &#39;absorbed&#39; in the Ottoman Empire, who, as always tried to &#39;Ottomize&#39; any country they conquered. (with little success) They lived peacefully together, until the majority (Greeks) wanted to &#39;Greekenize&#39; the whole island. (ENOSIS as you rightly said) - I still know time of Makarios without violence. - Looking at a population map, the Turks were a very small minority, before the Ankara massive intervention - the pieces of land stolen from ALL Cypriots (being them of Greek of Turkish descent and the creation of a &#39;hard&#39; border  is typically Turkish, sorry to say. Now the peace and reconciliation process can never happen, and old neighbours, if still alive can never come to each other for tea and fruits. I will ad one thing, I&#39;ve been to Yugoslavia &#39;before&#39; and there was not a hint there of hatred between the peoples back then. (all intermarried) In this case I hold Germany totally responsible for recognizing &#39;Slovenia&#39;, which let to Srebrenica much later in the war, with, again, with  right wing factions killing people. We all want peace and keep our neighbours close, colour, religion or tradition shouldn&#39;t be a part of it. Talat, if you love Turkey, you have to stop it&#39;s right wing tendencies (since Erdogan) - a nice link for you <a href=""https://euobserver.com/foreign/144366"">https://euobserver.com/foreign/144366</a> on how Erdogan kicked out any people who were against him. İyi olacaksın."
Comment 437.3	@Jan Verboven It seems like you dont know much history Cyprus was Turkish country more then hundred years , in fact it was never been a Greek country .With international law Turkey is one of the guarantor countries. Do you know the meaning of guarantor ? when the cyprus contitution was broken by Greeks and there was a coup by ENOSIS supporters Turkey had to step in. Do i need to tell you than many Turrkish cypriots were killed . On top of that it was the gGreeks who said no to Annan plan not the Turks . so who doesnt want peace? who doesnt want to live together ? why are you so one sided ? try to be a little fair.
Comment 437.4	Lol

Comment439	2011 Year , who said that the Assad regime should fall? Who held the terrorists with weapons ?? America and Europe no ??? Now the Turks are to blame? Licimers and poloetic prostitutes
Comment440	I hope the American MAGA and evangelical crowd are happy now, as they are now ISIS supporters.
Comment 440.1	We love isis. Sending them to you nOwOwOwOw
Comment 440.2	We, the US should have never been there to begin with. Now is as good a time as any to get the fuck out. We have China to deal with now anyhow and an economic mess coming.
Comment 440.3	@John Doe Turkey. Saudi, Qatar also funded ISIS though.
Comment 440.4	😂😂😂
Comment441	Usa lier usa lie lie lie lie lie lier. Go to trash usa
Comment442	All major news outlets parroting the erdogan war machine propaganda , how sad!
Comment443	Irak helping Syrien kurd
Comment 443.1	Iraq needs help itself!
Comment444	never ever rely on the international community for your defense. History repeats over and over. If you do not have nuclear weapons your country will be invaded and destroyed.
Comment 444.1	@Eason Van My enemies( or fwaming dwagon ) are currently counting on a binding resolution from them, so they can unf$#&amp; themselves.
Comment 444.2	Yes. Just like Ethiopia and China before the WW2 totally broke out. League of nations just do nothing to Italy and Japanese invasion. Never count on the United Nations.
Comment 444.3	@Shorsh Hawrami I pay extra for texts too, probably should get a new plan.
Comment 444.4	Shame on the BBC reporter in Turkey. well done for being a part of Turkish invasion propaganda. She was reading Defince ministary anouncement . As a text payer, it is a waste of our money, she could have done in in office in London! Shame
Comment445	This is very dangerous for ypg to take us weapons and make deal with russia and assad. This move is exact spineless terorist move that will annihilate their dreams. Neither usa nor russia silly. Noone will trust that terorists anymore. Fear of the turkish army make terorists acting like a beheaded chicken.
Comment 445.1	James Nichols ı m kurdish and ı am telling you YPG/PKK is terrorist 15 million kurds lives in peace in turkey 4 millions syrians lives in peace in turkey they are killing kurds-syrians-turks u cant know cuz your countrys news is fake
Comment 445.2	"Iski D.  <a href=""https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/10/11/syria-us-base-kurdish-clarissa-ward-intl-vpx.cnn"">https://edition.cnn.com/videos/world/2019/10/11/syria-us-base-kurdish-clarissa-ward-intl-vpx.cnn</a> this is one article on it, although I presume as america withdraws the Kurdish will abandon this, or maybe the Kurdish will take over the bases, although I believe it still isn’t known if one US base further south in syria will remain in operation"
Comment 445.3	@James Nichols are they protecting us bases ? PROTECTING USA. That&#39;s the most interesting thing that I have heard nowadays. Thanks for informing bro.
Comment 445.4	Except for the fact they’re not terrorists, and are still protecting the remaining US bases in Syria (the Kurds, as for whether or not erdogan is a terrorist is open to debate)
Comment446	Nuke Constantinople and Ankara
Comment 446.1	@talat guneyli that&#39;s what your sister and mother says
Comment 446.2	@DominatorCDA Founded by Constantine and will always be Constantinople, one day the Greek flag will fly over it again. Islam is a satanic sex cult that is dying.
Comment 446.3	Istanbul not Constantinople<br />Now its Istanbul not Constantinople.<br />Been a long time gone<br />Old Constantinople&#39;s still has Turkish delight<br />On a moonlight night.
Comment 446.4	&quot;I say we take off and nuke the entire site from orbit. It&#39;s the only way to be sure.&quot;
Comment 446.5	Nuke your ass !
Comment447	The hyprocisy they talk about children what about the children they killed when in the coalition
Comment448	"<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2d2uCCVF0A&amp;t=4m20s"">4:20</a> ‘accusing the kurds of setting IS free’ do they know how many kurdish lives were lost while fighting ISIS? 11,000 lives were lost. it is turkey that helped create and fund IS. all the isis members from america how did they get into syria?? it is because turkey allowed them to go through their border to syria. and now they are running their mouth saying kurds let isis free. you are not brainwashing anybody, you are only brainwashing the turkish people and not the world."
Comment 448.1	talat guneyli are you sure about that I know that US did more shit to save your asses than let your country crumble the US is the main man power of pushing away ISIS turkey isn’t you can say all the bs you want call me names idc cause deep down you know that turkey funded ISIS idgaf if you agree or not I’m just basing it on facts
Comment 448.2	Turkey fought pkk and killed them, turkey fought isis and killed them now ypg wants their share. You may fool ignorant and naive western folks like you did but you cant fool us. And eventually even western media will have to tell the truth. Ypg is controlled by pkk. You can see Abdullah Öcalan pictures in every office of them. And Öcalan is a marxist terrorist whose  nickname is baby killer.
Comment 448.3	@Beast _ Gago Check the battle field and see whos got the balls and who has not.
Comment 448.4	@Shorsh Hawrami I will tell you only one more thing, Turkey has been the number one target of isis terror attacks , no other country had so many attacks like Turkey. so if Turkey was supporting isis whocome it was the number one target ?
Comment 448.5	@talat guneyli Biden went to Turkey in 2014. Turkey did not participate by troops as Erdogan was hoping to seize power in Syria by Jihadist. Since no one stood up, US asked YPG to participate. The deal never happened between US and Turkey!
Comment449	Why should Erdogan listen to Trump now, after Trump greenlighted the Turkish incursion? And folks, this could get <b>much</b> worse. What about the nearly 90 tactical nuclear bombs the US has stored at a leased Turkish airbase (at Incirlik)? Are we leaving those behind as a gift for the Turks? Trump&#39;s decision must be the worst foreign policy mistake of the last 50 years!
Comment 449.1	@Gökalp Kartal Turks committed genocide and exterminated almost all of the Greeks, Armenians, Kurds, and everyone else that wasn&#39;t Turkish in an Anatolia that used to be extremely diverse. The Kurds have held out better than anyone just due to the fact that they&#39;ve resisted so hard and they managed to fall back into very rough low value terrain. Other groups that surrendered to Turkish rule didn&#39;t make it.<br /><br />Then there was the invasion of Europe and the genocide that took place all long the way into SE Europe before the groups being exterminated managed to unify and expel the Turks.<br /><br />Turks were well on their way to openly conquering Europe for the purpose of exterminating or forcibly converting the whole damn continent.<br /><br />Turks have been the biggest genocidal group in all of human history.
Comment 449.2	Winston Syme go and learn history turks never genocided in history
Comment 449.3	@Winston Syme Only thing our NATO allies fund is a terror organization that attacks Turkey for 40 years. NATO is nothing without Turkey, no containment of Russia, no access to middle east, no afghanistan. You are a true virgin for saying that Turkey is killing every non-Turk.
Comment 449.4	Removing Turkey from NATO is far more important in the long run than letting Russia, Syria, and the Kurds duke it out with Turkey now. This gives us a chance to get Turkey kicked out of NATO so that we aren&#39;t in this position with the Turks exploiting NATO to rebuild the Ottoman Empire and genociding every non-Turk they can get their hands on, while forcing the west to fund the whole thing and protect them from consequences.
Comment 449.5	remember nuclear bombs/atom bombs have expiration dates so its been past 50 years rendering them useless done cannot be dropped and expect to function like its supposed to most likely would cause a small radius of destruction just from the tnt but nothing else
Comment450	That&#39;s incredible how BBC can distorce facts...
Comment451	So the Kurds side with Syria and the Syrian army is actually gonna do something ! What a way to surprise the world perhaps the Middle East with solve their own problems this time but funding the PKK is the same as funding ISIS you know what , fuck em who cares ! This seems like a you problem Syria suck you
Comment452	Get Turkey the Hell out of NATO. Why the F are they a member of NATO
Comment453	Turks are killing innocent humans they cut the heads of Kurdish people they put fires 🔥 in the Kurdish villages from the 1980s to now turkey is doing war crimes against Kurdish people
Comment454	BBC playing both sides
Comment 454.1	That’s called reporting the news you dumbass. It’s good that they don’t only show one side. You’re probably used to having your opinion handed to you
Comment 454.2	BBC spreads false propaganda.<br />You can Google their baised and false reporting. <br />This broadcasting has no credibility.
Comment 454.3	That&#39;s a good thing lol
Comment 454.4	@Casimir Paul Simply not true. kurds have sham elections just like  Syrian gov does. <br /><br />Non-Kurds can not be a commander in Rojava
Comment 454.5	Bongo Frenzy y should they
Comment455	<b>Chaotic World</b>
Comment456	Assad and Erdogan along with Iraq should make a deal.<br />Turkey to cease their invasion.<br />Syria to take back all 3 million Syrian refugees currently living in Turkey<br />Kurds move to either Iraqi Kurdish territory or inland in Syria away from Turkish border.

Comment 469.2	They are literally ridding an area of terrorist vermin
Comment 469.3	@Beast _ Gago In 1915, under the provocation of the British, Armenians rebelled against the Ottomans. They shot the Ottoman troops from behind. the threat had arisen. For this reason, the Relocation Law was published. This law is the dispatch of internal elements in the war zones to remote places. During this migration, our soldiers provided the security of life and property of the displaced people. I think you should do some research before you talk about it.
Comment 469.4	@jayboy009 only the truths. But you must know better by sitting at your seat and drinking your hot tea from thousand mills away lol
